Badlands! Whatever you call it, the Farmington area has not only the slickrock of Alien Run Trail but singletrack threading through this picturesque terrain as well.\r\n\nBadlands are erosional landforms so there is lots of sand and silt. The arroyo crossings tend to be sandtraps and there are numerous short steep climbs that can be loose under foot. \r\n\nTake La Plata Highway (170) about 0.8 miles north from Pinon Hills Blvd. There is a large parking area and a chained gate. The sign on the gate says no motorcycles or ATVs but they are frequent users. Be sure to fasten the gate behind you as you cross private land onto BLM land.\r\n\nThe area is confusing because the singletrack has been overlaid by a web of motorcycle and ATV tracks. The Hiking Project mobile app is a necessity and starting a GPS odometer at the gate is highly recommended.\r\n\nAs you head up the road the sparsely-vegetated hills turn into badlands rather abruptly. At about 0.82 miles from the gate you'll see singletrack veer off to the left. Continue on up the valley, crossing roads and arroyos as the terrain develops hoodoos and tent rocks. \r\n\nIf you hear gunfire ahead, it's likely at King Tank. Approach with caution and noise so that a temporary cease-fire can be negotiated. This is desert BLM land after all, where the citizenry drinks beer, shoots guns, drills gas wells, twists throttles, stomps accelerators, and even mountain bikes.\r\n\nYou'll cross a broad valley at King Tank around 2.2 miles, feet crunching on shell casings of every caliber and description. Watch out for glass too, here and in other spots. It is fairly conspicuous and localized.\r\n\nAt about 4 miles you'll ascend steeply up onto Pinon Mesa. There is a fair bit of road in this section, but eventually you'll get back on singletrack.\r\n\nAround 6.6 miles you'll start to turn east, then at 7.7 to the south. Watch the Hiking Project mobile app in this area as various routes will take you off into oblivion.\r\n\nNow you'll head downhill through Pinon forest for a couple miles, with lots of short climbs. This is almost all fine singletrack. \r\n\nAround 11.5 miles you transition back to Badlands. There are narrow sand ridges that exclude motos here.\r\n\nAt 12.4 miles turn south onto a gas line road and complete the loop.", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7036290/final-section-of-gas-line-road-completes-the-loop", "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 3}, "stats": {"dist": 14.8, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [6156, 5308], "alt-change": [1397, 1341], "avg-grade": 4.0, "max-grade": 25.0}},

In about one-half mile, the trail forks. Take the right fork, which keeps you on the Borrego Trail. The trail climbs onto a ridge with long sweeping switchbacks. Then a narrow section of trail drops you to Tesuque Creek. You cross over to the north side of the creek, turn right on Winsor National Recreation Trail to Pacheco Canyon Rd. and follow it to Aspen Ranch. \r\n\nFrom Aspen Ranch, follow the road 100 yards to the north, and just before you reach a locked gate the trail will branch off to the west.  At this point, the trail and the Rio en Medio Trail #163 piggyback on top of each other for a short distance.  The trail will wind around some private land and drop down to and cross the Rio en Medio.  \r\n\nFollow the Rio en Medio Trail downstream for a short distance and you'll see a junction to the north.  This is where the Borrego Trail leaves the Rio en Medio trail, and follow the Borrego Trail back up to the road you had been following earlier.  Continue north along the road for 1/4 mile and you'll see the Borrego Trail junction off of the road and continue to the north.  \r\n\nFrom here, the trail begins down a side canyon to the Rio Nambe.  After crossing to the north side of the Rio Nambe, proceed about a quarter mile up the canyon and look to the north for a sign post marking the continuation of the Borrego Trail.  From here the trail will climb over the pass separating the Rio Nambe drainage and the Rio Capulin drainage.  After dropping down to the Rio Capulin, cross to the north side, go downstream a little bit and look for the trail continuing north.   \r\n\nAfter another pass, the trail begins down to the Rio Frijoles.  Cross to the north side of the Rio Frijoles, proceed upstream for a few hundred yards and look for the trail heading north up the hillside.  The trail climbs up to another pass above Agua Sarca Canyon and then descends into the Rito Gallina Canyon.  Here the trail levels off quite a bit and descends gradually to the Rio Medio.  This river can be quite substantial at this point, and fording it may be a challenge, especially during the peak runoff time in early spring.

Enter the Pecos Wilderness, and you'll soon emerge above treeline, into a low scrubby alpine tundra environment.  Follow the rock cairns uphill, being careful to stay on the well-established route; alpine tundra can be very susceptible to damage from excessive foot traffic. After a short climb you'll arrive at the summit of  Deception Peak, with Nambe Lake directly below you to the north.  Just across a small gap to the northeast is the summit of Lake Peak.  A steep scramble to the east is necessary here to get from Deception Peak to the faint trail along the shoulder of Lake Peak, and to continue along the narrow rocky ridge that separates Lake Peak and Penitente Peak.   Travel here with stock such horses or llamas is not possible. You'll again pick up the trail on this ridge, with a drop to a saddle between the peaks and another climb to the wide grassy top of  Penitente Peak.  The area south of this ridge is the Santa Fe Watershed providing water to the City of Santa Fe.  This entire drainage area is closed to all entry and recreational use.  \r\n\nFrom Penitente Peak, follow the trail down the gentle northeast ridge by following the rock cairns, and watch for the spot where the trail again enters the timber.  After a descent with several switchbacks you'll find a junction with the Winsor Trail #254.  Turn left here and follow the combined Skyline and Winsor Trails to the grassy meadows of Puerto Nambe.  Look for the post and sign marking the junction, where the Skyline Trail again parts company with the Winsor, and turns to the north, climbing steeply up the shoulders of Santa Fe Baldy.  After several switchbacks you'll arrive at a high saddle below the summit of Santa Fe Baldy.  From here one can follow the ridge to the west, where there is a well-worn route to access the peak, or continue along the Skyline Trail to Lake Katherine, which sits in a high glacial cirque.  \r\n\nThe trail down the north side of this saddle is normally snow packed until the end of June and often into July, even when the rest of the trail is clear.

To access the trail, you can park in the visitor parking lot and follow the Chihuahuan Desert Nature Trail down to the road, or you can go toward the cave entrance and follow the old road on the right side of the cave. Note, if you approach the cave entrance, you'll need to explain to the ranger there that you are hiking the Old Guano Road Trail so that they let you pass with food, water, and whatever else you might be carrying. \r\n\nThe old road departs the natural entrance to Carlsbad Cavern and follows a portion of the Chihuahuan Desert Nature Trail, which provides some information on the plants and animals that you'll encounter on the trail. The Chihuahuan Desert Nature Trail breaks off to the right while the Old Guano Road Trail continues straight ahead and begins to narrow. Approaching a chain-link fence roughly a tenth of a mile later, the trail breaks off to the right of the fence (this fence blocks an old entrance that was blasted into the cave in order to help haul the guano out of the cave). In this area, you may notice old, rusted cans and lids from the early 1900s. Please leave them alone so that others can enjoy them as well.\r\n\nThe trail continues ahead as little more than an animal path as it makes a slow descent toward Whites City. On the left-hand side of the trail, you'll glimpse views of the canyons found within the national park that are hidden from the roads. On the right-hand side, sweeping views of the New Mexico and Texas landscape spread out before you, with the Guadalupe Mountains off in the distance. Follow the cairns and posts that mark the trail through the gently sloping landscape. Watch your step as lizards and other reptiles might be on the trail, especially during the heat of the day. \r\n\nRounding a bend in the trail at roughly 2.75 miles, you'll enjoy the first views of Whites City as the descent begins to steepen. After 3.25 miles, the trail descends the hillside even more steeply and becomes slightly harder to follow. Flowering cacti can be seen on either side of the trail, especially in the spring.

There is a small pullout opposite the trailhead that allows parking for 2-3 cars at most. The trail departs the parking area across the road and begins climbing up the side of the hill. The trail is narrow and marked with rock cairns to help guide you along the way. \r\n\nThe trail is not heavily used, as most of the visitors to Carlsbad Cavern come for the caves, so it doesn't get a lot of travelers. Cacti and other desert plants grow close to the side of the trail, making pants a necessity as they brush up against your legs. The trail climbs fairly gently for the first .4 miles. Take an opportunity to turn around and enjoy the view of the surrounding canyons as you climb away from the road. \r\n\nThe trail begins to climb more steeply as it passes half a mile.  As the trail is difficult to follow, make sure you can see the cairns as you progress. At roughly .85 miles, the trail encounters the park boundary along a barbwire fence that separates the park from the surrounding countryside. Sweeping views outside of the park spread out before you, so take a moment to enjoy the view.  Looking back towards the visitor center, you can enjoy views of the canyon and surrounding hillsides.\r\n\nAt this point, the trail cuts to the left and follows the fence for roughly a quarter of the mile. The trail continues to be little more than an animal path amongst cairns, but the going is level at this point making the journey easy. The cairns begin to fade, but you can continue to explore along the fence line for a while further. To get back to your car, you can follow the cairns along the path that you originally traveled or you can cut cross country making your way down to the road and follow that back to your car.   \r\n\nThe trails in Carlsbad National Park are primitive, so make sure that you have enough sunscreen, clothing, food, and water for your hike.

The trail can be split into two sections as both of these sections have their own characteristics. The first section from Oliver Lee State Park climbs quickly on steep, rocky switchbacks and some rocky, rolling hard pack 2.9 miles through National Forest land up to a bench (2.5mi) that holds grasslands and some sizeable boulders. The cliffs to the south of this section are incredible. From here, the trail drops into the canyon to the old Line Cabin deep in Dog Canyon at 2.9 miles where there is a stream and respite from the harsher environs of the desert. The trail is marked every 1/4 mile with brown trail stakes. This portion of the trail is well traveled and easy to navigate. \r\n\nThe upper portion of the trail begins at the Line Cabin and climbs up out of the canyon on the north side and skirts a cliff face, with amazing views of the basin, for a couple hundred feet. Steeper grades are found on this section and slowing down is usually a must. As the trail climbs, the vegetation and trail changes a bit. Although still rocky and steep, there are areas of high desert dirt with pi\u00f1on and juniper lining the trail as you close in on FR-90B and the upper trailhead. The last 0.75 miles to 90B flattens out some and it is not uncommon to spot elk in this section.\r\n\nHikers are scarce in Dog Canyon, especially during the week. Weekend visitors are common and are usually terrific on the trail. Climbing 3,300 ft in 5.5 miles demands some steep grades of 25%-45% in some spots. \r\n\nHiking this trail is challenging, but the views of the Tularosa Basin, White Sands National Monument, and Organ Mountains are unparalleled and are visible for nearly the entirety of this trail.

Located a few blocks south of Sudderth Drive, Ruidoso's main street, it's a nearby diversion for visitors to this popular mountain town.\r\n\nThe trailhead is at the back of the parking lot north of Grindstone Lake. The path is mostly smooth dirt singletrack with a few large rocks to navigate. The first mile and a half alternates between forested and open areas; the treeless sections can be gusty during the windy season. Watch for a few hidden uneven segments, where underlying rocks are covered by dirt. A nice overlook of the canyon and lake can be had near the half mile point. A large clearing near the mile marker makes a great spot to watch the sun rise. From here, the trail begins a steady climb.\r\n\nA signed turnoff for the excellent Alfred Hale Connector is found soon after. Most of the rocks begin to fade from the path, giving way to smooth dirt and pine needles. As the trail turns south around two miles in, it opens up to stellar views of Grindstone Lake and the city of Ruidoso. The southwest corner of the trail marks its high point, and it begins to descend in a series of curves and switchbacks. The path passes around a number of gullies before merging briefly into a gravel road around the three and three quarter mile point.\r\n\nThe eastern end of Grindstone Ridge Connector is shortly ahead and to the right. The Lake Trail continues a hundred feet after, on the left. Look for a large arrow made of stones pointing in the right direction. For the next two miles the trail clings to the hillside, circling above small valleys rising up from the lake, which is occasionally visible below. The path follows a number of easy up and down segments as it goes, followed by the final descent to the water around the five mile point.\r\n\nThe eastern turnoff for Grindstone Ridge Trail can be found shortly into the descent, marked by a sign. Two long switchbacks follow, and the lake fully comes into view. The route then turns west to circle the water as it flattens out, passing a connector to Fisherman's Trail. Keep left to stay on the main path.\r\n\nA series of tight hairpins then connects to a gravel road at the six and a quarter mile point.

The northern intersection meets the top of Alfred Hale Connector and is marked by a sign. Taking the trail in a counterclockwise direction, it begins as an easy, flat, dirt singletrack. In contrast to other trails in the Grindstone Lake area, this northern section of the Mesa Loop is much more open, crossing large clearings with trees spaced further apart.\r\n\nNumerous signs remind trail users that they are in an active logging area, and the trail crosses dirt access roads at a few points. This, combined with occasional heavy pine needle cover underfoot, can make the path hard to find at times. Look for pink markers tied to trees and saplings to help mark the way. Don't confuse them for the lines spray painted across trunks, however, as these are markings for the loggers.\r\n\nOccasional pathfinding issues aside, the Mesa Loop is an easy hike. A road crossing at the hairpin near the one mile point offers an opportunity to take a shortcut, if desired. Not long after - at the mile and two thirds point, if taking the full length - the path begins its short challenging section. Here, the trail becomes moderately rocky and technical, especially by Grindstone trail standards. It lasts for about a quarter mile before returning to smooth singletrack. Look out towards the western valley passing through this area, where circling hawks can often be spotted. As the trail continues to the southeast, it leaves behind the clearings of its first portion for more wooded areas.\r\n\nThe intersection with the Grindstone Ridge Connector is found just before the two and a half mile point, marked by a sign and a huge rock cairn.

After 1,500 feet, at the turnoff for the Altura Segment, the trail narrows to singletrack and becomes a little more technical, with some short descents and climbs.\r\n\nAs the trail turns to the south, it passes a field of hundreds of boulders. Keep left as the trail forks, and watch for larger, watermelon-sized stones and flat rocks as the trail crosses Turtleback Trail and switches back in an easy descent to the hill's base. Tortugas crosses Observatory Road near an old shack; again, keep left, and look for a marker showing where the trail picks up on the other side of the road. A sidetrack to Ocotillo Loop is shortly thereafter.\r\n\nThe main trail soon joins a wider dirt road. The path here is sandy but shallow, so it isn't too difficult to hike on. The road narrows and becomes firmer as it turns east and draws nearer to the mountain. Look for the distinctive Bishop Cap formation to the south. Crossing the turnoff for Arroyo Loop, Tortugas turns back to singletrack and is similar to the north side segments, with a few rocky sections and brief ups and downs.\r\n\nA few splits in the trail can be found on the east side.

The trail is an approachable, moderate ascent from the parking lot, but it is best experienced downhill, where hikers can enjoy outstanding views of Albuquerque and the high desert beyond.\r\n\nThe beginning of the trail on its eastern end has two starting points. As depicted on the GPS track here, the Horse Trail begins across a small ravine from Embudo Trail as a clearly visible singletrack. There is also a short segment a couple hundred feet down connecting further west on Embudo Trail; a wooden marker shows this intersection.\r\n\nThe trail is a fairly clean dirt singletrack, although a bit susceptible to muddy conditions in wet weather. Rocks and plants tend to crowd closer in to the Horse Trail than they will on Embudo Trail, and can make the path a little technical at times. Tree shade provides some nice relief from the sun in warmer months but can make ice linger in cooler weather.\r\n\nThe initial third of a mile is a flat, winding trip through the trees that opens up to the first of many excellent vistas. The Horse Trail then begins a quick descent until reaching the mile point, crossing a few faint trails as it goes. Most of these are short exploratory paths that don't go far from the main trail, with the exception of Embudo Shortcut, a steep connector to the north. It then enters an interesting field of boulders, running abruptly into an enormous one just before the shortcut. Circle around clockwise, then turn left at the tall wooden signpost on the other side.\r\n\nStill descending, the Horse Trail begins to enter the flatland portions of the Open Space. Markers are placed intermittently along the path to help in this maze-like area. The path passes through a wooden gate and crosses Mano Trail, changing from hard packed dirt to gritty sand and crossing the first of two wooden footbridges. The Horse Trail flattens as it briefly joins the Foothills Trail, splitting off again to the right after a few hundred feet. The second footbridge follows.\r\n\nThe final segment of Embudo Horse Trail is a half-mile clockwise circle around a foothill. Clinging to the side of the hill, the trail overlooks a grassy valley to the south and picturesque New Mexican-style homes to the west.

You'll meander on, passing decent sized boulders and juniper. This part is sun-exposed but you'll get a great feel for the canyon and higher mountains around.\r\n\nYou'll eventually start to hit some switchbacks and a solid Intermediate section.

This is likely the namesake Three Gun Springs as it allows different types of trees to grow lower than normal. This section is steep, loose, and tough. Power through and you come out of the canyon on the ridge and into the ponderosa pines. Here you'll intersect with the Embudo Trail.

This is the condition the trail will be in for most of its length. The path makes a number of small climbs over the short ridges and gullies of the foothills. A good variety of lowland desert plants circle the trail, with an unusually dense number of barrel cacti, native to this region.\r\n\nAfter circling around a few outlier hills and passing through a gate, Sierra Vista crosses a road and continues past the Talavera trailhead. The trail through this section is similar to the previous one, a bit rockier but uncomplicated and with great mountain views. As the trail leaves behind the homes along the foothills, it passes through a field of white thorn bushes and merges briefly with a dirt road before continuing south. Near the six mile point, it briefly follows a barbed wire fence. At the end, it reaches the Wilderness Study Area, a section thick with plant life.\r\n\nAs the path approaches the Pena Blanca trailhead, its namesake rock formation becomes visible to the southeast. Continue across the dirt road to the third trail section. The initial portion, in an arroyo, can be hard to follow, so use the GPS track to stay on course. Some interesting caves can be seen along the mountains through here, along with the prominent Bishop Cap formation. As the trail moves away from the mountains around the thirteen mile point, it enters a grassland and becomes hard packed sand. After a few miles it returns to rolling over the ridges, coming to another trailhead.\r\n\nSouth of Vado, the trail follows a straight, dull dirt road for six miles. The crossover at 20.5 is along a washout; use the GPS for reference. It then turns east along another road, bypasses a washout, and crosses over to the east side of the mountains. The crossover segment is in poor condition and overgrown, so be careful. The next segment is along a flat, easy dirt road. Hikers may hear the tanks of Ft. Bliss practicing to the east.\r\n\nAfter crossing the highway, Sierra Vista returns to singletrack once more.

Look for a brown trail marker (showing the direction for Sierra Vista, not La Maria), and an clearly visible singletrack heading to the southwest. The path is mostly grit and packed dirt. A few softball to volleyball sized rocks are present throughout, but they're spread far enough apart to not cause any real issues. As it proceeds, La Maria makes a very gradual, easy descent away from the mountains. The trail winds frequently but doesn't take many significant turns.\r\n\nA shortcut across the loop can be found about two-thirds of a mile in. It is unmarked, but like the beginning, the singletrack is easy enough to spot. Not much changes as the trail makes a gradual U-turn on its western flank to return towards the mountains. A segment on the southwest corner connects to a nearby neighborhood.\r\n\nMore experienced hikers may find themselves a little bored by the trail's uniformity. However, the abundant plant life and wide-reaching views redeem La Maria. On a clear day, hikers can see for literally hundreds of miles. Las Cruces is ringed by mountains, with the Organs to the east, the Robledos to the north, the Potrillos to the west, and the Franklins to the south.

Because of the length of the trail and the distance between the trailheads, Piedra Lisa Trail #135 is often separated into two hikes, Piedra Lisa South (2 miles) and Piedra Lisa North (3.8 miles). Piedra Lisa is intersected by several other trails: Movie Trail, Fletcher Trail, Rincon Spur Trail, and Del Agua Trail.\r\n\nPiedra Lisa's southern trail is a well-traveled trail and is very popular amongst hikers and trail runners. The trail begins at the southern trailhead and soon leads into Juan Tabo Canyon. After three-quarters of a mile is the junction of upper Juan Tabo Canyon and Waterfall Canyon and nearby the intersection of two trails. Movie Trail heads along the ridge between upper Juan Tabo Canyon and Waterfall Canyon. Fletcher Trail travels northeast further into upper Juan Tabo Canyon. Both trails are part of the area that is closed from March 1 to August 15 to protect wildlife. Piedra Lisa trail steepens after this point as it ascends north up Juan Tabo ridge, allowing hikers to observe spectacular views into the canyons and of the imposing rock formations comprising Sandia Mountain's western face.\r\n\nMost people continue their ascent to approximately the second mile mark and the intersection with the Rincon Spur Trail. From here, most will either head back or continue up the rugged Rincon Spur Trail for the amazing views and then head back down. However, if you are seeking more of a challenge, follow the sign indicating the continuation of Piedra Lisa to the north.\r\n\nThe less-traveled northern portion of Piedra Lisa descends into the southern branch of Del Agua Canyon. The trail offers easier travel through shady tree cover for about a mile before transitioning into a sandy canyon. The trail can become indistinct in some places so be mindful when traveling through this portion. Continuing north another mile, the trail soon passes the junction with Del Agua Trail #248, a route which continues up the north branch of Del Agua Canyon.

There are still remnants of religious artifacts at Hermit's Peak that should not be disturbed. \r\n\nThis short spur trail heads up to the summit branching off the Hermit's Peak Trail #223.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7059752/enjoying-the-views-at-the-edge-of-hermits-peak", "ratings": {"rating": 5.0, "num_reviewers": 3}, "stats": {"dist": 0.5, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [10191, 9907], "alt-change": [185, 365], "avg-grade": 19.0, "max-grade": 30.0}},

The ultimate plan over the next few years is to complete the CDT in this area and connect it to where the CDT ends at LS Mesa, creating a continuous singletrack from Sapillo campground down to Lordsburg. \r\n\nAccessing this trail will likely require an off-road capable vehicle such as a truck or jeep. Begin by driving north out of Silver City on Highway 180 to Saddlerock. Turn onto Saddlerock Road and make sure you stay right at the major junction or you'll end up turning onto the wrong road. \r\n\nPrior to this junction (Saddle Rock, Gila National Forest road 810 / Black Hawk, forest road 118), the road will become a rough and sandy wash unsuitable for most vehicles that lack clearance and/or off road capabilities. Alternatively, you could simply park at one of the many areas capable of accommodating vehicles on the side of the road before the conditions deteriorate and then hike the remainder of the path to access the trail. \r\n\nEventually, the road will end at a large gate where that path narrows and becomes even sandier. This is the entrance to Goat Canyon. Even though maps indicate Saddlerock Road continues, conditions will become virtually un-drivable. Park behind the gate and begin your hike up Goat Canyon. \r\n\nAfter a brief hike through the sand-filled canyon floor, you'll see a trail marker and what looks to be the entrance to a narrow canyon off to your right. Take the right turn and get ready to negotiate a sandy and rocky ascent through the canyon until it intersects the doubletrack road again. Turn right onto the doubletrack and complete a short but robust climb that takes you to where the road intersects the Continental Divide Trail.  \r\n\nTurn right and head north on the singletrack. Much of this trail consists of descending accented by a few rough patches and tight switchbacks. Eventually, the trail will simply fade out after descending into a creek bed south of Blacksmith Canyon. Hopefully, additional funding and interest will ensure the trail work is completed, but at this time (2017), your only option is to turn around and hike back out.\r\n\nAlso be aware that several sections of the trail are overgrown by catclaw, so wearing leg protection is a good idea to protect yourself from the inevitable scratches that are sure to come.", "condition": "Unknown"}, "ratings": {"rating": 5.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 6.7, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [5971, 5135], "alt-change": [459, 1159], "avg-grade": 5.0, "max-grade": 19.0}},

If you miss the turnoff, you'll eventually run into a dead end canyon. \n\nAfter leaving the creek, the trail begins to climb more steeply, gaining most of its elevation over the remain mile and a half. After passing through a short sandy area, you'll soon join another creek bed, which you'll stay along most of the way. Watch overhead for the cables of the tramway; the crash site is almost directly beneath it. \n\nShortly before reaching the crash site, you'll come across a large rock formation that you'll need to climb to continue. A well-placed branch has been left there to help out. \n\nContinue past the rocks through some dense brush for about a quarter mile to the final resting place of TWA Flight 260. The trail continues directly to the first pieces of debris; part of the fuselage near the cockpit and a large section with the number 416 on the side.

Lesser-known than the popular trails to the north, Embudo is a fun, dynamic route through a variety of terrain and plant life.\r\n\nEmbudo's initial segment doubles as a dirt access road to the nearby water tank. The gritty, sandy trail is smooth and well maintained, making for an easy hike. As it makes a gradual ascent to the east, look right to see an interesting boulder field across the valley. The path will cross three dirt singletracks on the way up, eventually passing the Embudo Freeride Area at the half mile point, a small terrain park for mountain bikers.\r\n\nSoon thereafter, Embudo briefly joins the Foothills Trail before heading east again at a large sign. This is the \"real\" beginning of the trail, as it leaves the flat section and enters Embudo Canyon. The path narrows and becomes more rugged as it proceeds through the tight canyon walls. In some areas, the trail will split; taking the left route is usually the more direct path. Diversions end up in the same place, however, so feel free to explore a little. Rocks and boulders begin to crop up along Embudo, and some sections will require some minor climbing. Moderately challenging but accessible to just about any hiker, the terrain makes for a fun, exciting route.\r\n\nAround the one mile point, the trail comes to a rock wall at a spring and turns left. Use caution when crossing rocks made wet by the runoff here. More scrambling follows over the next quarter mile. Again, when the trail splits, the left route is generally easier, with the right climbing over more boulders. Look for a few rock overhangs making some small caves.\r\n\nEventually Embudo flattens out in a wide valley. The singletrack returns to mostly packed dirt as it weaves through trees. Depending on which of a few trail spurs are taken, the path meets Embudo Horse Trail near a small arroyo. Cacti give way to pine trees as the winding trail nears the back of the canyon. Watch for patches of snow and ice late in the year in shady sections.\r\n\nAt the canyon wall, the trail begins a series of steep, demanding switchbacks. A few rocks make the climb harder. The challenging climb will last for the final three quarters of a mile, with the canyon walls framing a nice view of Albuquerque to the west.\r\n\nEmbudo Trail ends at the top of a lower saddle on the Sandias.

Take a left to head north on Filmore Canyon Trail; after a little less than a mile you'll reach the junction with Organ Needle Trail. \r\n\nHiking on Organ Needle Trail, shortly before you enter the canyon itself, there will be a section of grey rock to climb to your left; at the top there is a sign designating the Modoc Mill Site. From here, move west (towards town) to the edge of the little hilltop, then north (right) to find a trail. Follow this trail NE for a mile or so. The trail is braided, but fairly well-worn and marked with cairns. About a mile from the Modoc Mill site, you'll pass closely by a large yellow rock formation; the trail from here gets progressively steeper.\r\n\nKeep heading NE, and the trail follows along the base of the north face of what is called the Grey Eminence (a large mass of grey rock). The trail meanders mainly up among juniper trees and at one point crosses a narrow scree slope. Coming out at the top of the Grey Eminence, you enter Juniper Saddle, a welcome respite and a good viewpoint. The trail then continues up the extremely steep slope you see to the NE.\r\n\nFollow the trail that leads towards the slope, which then climbs along the base of the SW-facing wall and eventually comes to a large area of bare rock by a seasonal waterfall. Follow this up, entering a brushy gully, and keep an eye out for cairns and ribbons that will guide you to the left; do not follow this gully too high up or you'll enter the wrong canyon at the top. Now headed more north than before, look for a large juiper tree in another waterway that marks your next turn (remember this well on your way down!). Go right, and follow the gully up into Dark Canyon.\r\n\nThe climb through this canyon ends right on the ridge of the Organs, and you'll be able to see WSMR and Sugarloaf Peak ahead of you. Descend about 50 vertical feet, following the trail to the north (left), and you'll come to a point where a large rock and a small tree impede your way. Go over or around this, then head to the left (west), climbing up the gully. You'll know you are at the right place when you see to the right at the top of the gully the iconic 6\" wide diagonal seam in the rock face that you'll need to climb next. As of Fall 2017, a previous climber has left a rope to assist your climb (but be wary of any gear left behind-never rely too fully on gear you don't know the history of).

This hike is fairly remote so take your time and don't get hurt. I wouldn't recommend it for a person that isn't familiar with desert hiking or route finding. Also, be snake aware (year-round)! \r\n\nGetting There \r\n\nFollow A019 north past the no trespassing and private property signs. These signs were put there by the \"Flying U\" ranch and can be misleading upon first seeing them. They are basically stating that you need to stay on the road until you reach BLM land. Do not be dissuaded. Lots of people go drink and shoot guns on rancher's land and these signs are up to limit that type of activity, not to stop you from accessing the peak. It is a county road and you have a right to proceed (there are not any gates because it is publicly owned). The final 0.5 of the access road (after turning west off A019) requires an 4x4 drive vehicle. A 4x4 is not needed to reach BLM land, just be prepared to add an extra mile (round-trip) to the hike. \r\n\nThe Route\r\n\nUse the southern trail noted by a dotted line found on most trail maps which passes near Rattlesnake Ridge. I suggest downloading the map offline as there are a couple of spots along the trail which are hard to navigate without GPS. To reiterate, do not take the northern route, this on private property!\r\n\nThe Hike\r\n\nOverall, this is a slow hike as the trail is not maintained. Be prepared for a 4-7 hour outing without any drinkable water along the trail. Be on the lookout for rock cairns. The easiest to miss turn comes when heading up the canyon as the trail is very washed out. The majority of the trail is scattered with rocks which slows progress (but not problematic). Upon reaching the upper ridge, the views are great on both sides of the peak and offer views up to 80 miles. The final scramble is straight forward, you do not need a rope, there are lots of holds and foot placements. \r\n\nFinal Thoughts\r\n\nThis is a great hike if you have already explored parts of the desert southwest and are looking for a trail to get away from people.

It originally continued along a very steep descent to Guaje Canyon; this northern portion of the trail was, for many years, considered impassable due to the affects of the Cerro Grande fire (May 2000) and the June 2011 Las Conchas fire and subsequent flooding/erosion damage. In late 2018, volunteers worked with the USFS to restore this northern portion, a.k.a North Mitchell Trail, and it's now a great way to access Guaje Canyon and the old Guaje Reservoir from the town of Los Alamos. \r\n\nFrom the trailhead on Arizona Street, travel uphill a short distance to meet the Perimeter Trail coming in from the left, proceed over a low ridge and continue straight when the Perimeter Trail heads to the right. Skirt below a water tank and make a crossing of a dry stream channel. The original trail use to stay in the canyon bottom but flooding in the canyon after the 2011 Las Conchas fire, more or less wiped out the trail. Circa 2014, the Mitchell Trail was officially re-routed by the USFS up out of the canyon and onto the ridge to the west of the canyon. There is an official sign marking the left turn up out of the canyon bottom. There is still a decent use trail in the canyon bottom used by hikers heading to the Natural Arch Trail and this use trail continues through the canyon to the intersection of the \"new\" trail where it heads up the steep switchbacks to Guaje Ridge.\r\n\nAfter about a mile, the Mitchell Trail turns north and steeply ascends to a saddle. Guaje Ridge, hidden until now, is still one half mile and 400 feet of elevation gain ahead. The intersection with the Guaje Ridge Trail #285 is near a plaque honoring the late trail builder, David Mitchell. \r\n\nProceeding west on the Guaje Ridge Trail leads to Pipeline Road and the Guaje Canyon Trail near the eastern border of the Valles Caldera National Preserve.

Use the Punto de Coyote Vista Point Spur to access the upper overlook. Look for the bench at the overlook for views over Questa.\r\n\nThe distance from the East Trailhead to the West Trailhead is 6.45 miles on the overlapping Las Vistas de Questa Trail. It is about 80% singletrack. The trail is mostly easy with a few technical and rocky sections where you'll want to watch your footing. \r\n\nOverall, it is easy to find. Watch for the brown sign about two miles north of Questa for Vistas de Questa.

It is entirely singletrack and replaced the old, steep, and eroded route that climbed the avalanche path below the Wheeler-Walter Saddle.\r\n\nAt approximately Mile 1.9 along the Williams Lake Trail #62, watch for a sign for Wheeler Peak. The trail begins here on the saddle above the lake, heading southeast then climbing east up Wheeler Peak's northwest slopes. The route meanders through mixed-conifer forests then steepens as it begins climbing switchbacks. From here, the route crosses through a steep gully and across a series of avalanche chutes on the approach to treeline. There are several open vistas and good views of Williams Lake and the rugged, high peaks across the basin.\r\n\nAfter the fifth switchback, the trail ascends above treeline and levels out into a large glacial basin. Evidence of glaciers receding is apparent in the large boulder fields and moraines strewn across the terrain. There are some great spots to find a good view and hang out or enjoy a snack before making the summit push. Continuing to the south, through a couple scree fields, the tread is narrow and uneven but not technical. There are ten switchbacks before the trail reaches the ridge and joins with the Wheeler Peak Trail #90 near the Mount Walter-Wheeler Saddle. From here, the summit is a short climb to the south (right). At the top, explore a monument explaining why the mountain is so named, a registry paper if you wish to sign and document your summit experience, and plenty of spots to enjoy the 360-degree views of the Sangre de Cristos and the Rio Grande Valley beyond.\r\n\nThere are several alpine routes that can be connected from the summit, linking up with the East Fork Trail #56 and Lost Lake Trail #91, and the Wheeler Peak Trail #90 leading to Frazer and Bull-of-the-Woods mountains. There is a primitive route traversing the ridge around the Williams Lake Basin that allows summits of Simpson Peak, West Simpson, Sin Nombre, Lake Fork, and Kachina Peaks before descending into Twining and the Village of Taos Ski Valley.

You can easily connect with 10 K and Golden Eagle or King of the Mountain for a fun adventure, or keep heading down to where the trail is less travelled and can be tricky to find at times. Hopefully, the GPX and having this on MTB Project will help with that.\r\n\nIf solitude and some fun challenge is what you are after, this is a great trail.", "condition": "Unknown"}, "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 4.2, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [10291, 8646], "alt-change": [109, 1754], "avg-grade": 8.0, "max-grade": 21.0}},

The Alien Run Outer Limits extension throws in rocky climbs and plunging downhills. It's a remarkable mix including one of the largest selections of slickrock in New Mexico.\r\n\nTo reach the trailhead, start at the main junction in Aztec where 544 and 550 meet. Drive 4 mi NE on 550. Turn right on 2770. Go east 2.7 mi, then take a left and go north 0.5 miles past a large gas installation. Just beyond a cattle guard, turn right. Go 0.4 miles to the trailhead. \r\n\nAll of these are heavily used gas well service roads that will be messy in wet weather. When driving and hiking in this area watch out for \"identified flying objects\" -- gas field vehicles moving at high velocity!\r\n\nThe sign at the trailhead shows 5, 10, and 19 mile options. The distance is actually 16 mi, not 19, for Outer Limits. This description will cover the 10 mile loop. It is directional: hike counter-clockwise.\r\n\nThe first section is a nice warmup on a dirt path, swooping in and out of small arroyos just back from the rim of Hart Canyon. Soon you are hiking on a mixture of slickrock and distinct trail.\r\n\nAt 2.3 mi there is an optional \"Black Hole\" loop that rolls around the convexities and concavities of the canyon edge.\r\n\nNow the hiking is mostly on slickrock with Moab-style paint arrows. Some are faded or missing so a bit of route finding may be needed.\r\n\nAt 2.9 miles you can turn left and do the 5 mile loop. Otherwise, carry on along the rim.\r\n\nAlien Run was developed by Al & Deral Saiz of Aztec. Around 3.2 mi you see an example of their design skills. The trail leaves the rim and climbs up a canyon through boulders to reach another level of rim. This terrain change completely alters the character of the trail.\r\n\nAround mile 4, the alleged \"UFO Crash Site\" is off to the left somewhere. Cue the \"Close Encounters\" soundtrack!\r\n\nAt 4.3 mi you reach the Alien Run Outer Limits option.

Its name is Spanish for \"big head.\" Rising at about 8,000 feet above sea level and 2,000 feet above the Rio Puerco Valley floor, Cabezon Peak is the most prominent of approximately fifty volcanic necks in the volcanic field of Mount Taylor.\r\n\nThe hike to the summit is mostly Class 2 scrambling up steep and rocky terrain with a few sections of Class 3 climbing. The Bureau of Land Management recommends wearing a hardhat due to the potential danger of falling rocks. This is especially a risk if you are traveling in a group and are ascending behind someone else.\r\n\nIf accessing from Albuquerque, take I-25 North for about 17 miles to US 550 West. Continue for about 41 miles and turn left on NM 279 past the village of San Luis. At this point the pavement ends and the road can become treacherous in inclement weather. Keep left at the fork and after 1.5 miles on the left you'll see the BLM sign for Cabezon Peak. You can follow the accompanying dirt route to a decent parking area, although higher clearance vehicles are recommended. \r\n\nHeading northeast up a vague trail amongst loose rocks, you'll soon encounter the first Class 3 section. Faint red arrows painted on the rocks indicate to go \"up.\" Shortly after this ascent, the gully will become more obvious. After ascending the gully, you'll emerge on small flat section of rock with a great view of valley. Continue your ascent up to the moss-covered rocks to your left and soon a cairn will mark the correct route on a fairly obvious trail.\r\n\nFrom the Cabezon Peak Trail, continue scrambling northeastward on the faint trail as another red arrow on a rock pointing upwards indicates the correct route. Do not follow the foot path to its termination under the large tree; instead, begin the hike's final scramble by going up the large rocks south of the tree (you want to be above it and to the left). All that remains is a hike along an obvious trail leading to the summit's rock shelter in which you'll find the summit registry and be rewarded with fantastic views of the Rio Puerco Valley and its various land formations.", "features": "Views", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7059417/the-first-class-iii-section-the-red-arrows-indicate-to-go-up", "ratings": {"rating": 5.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 0.3, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [7772, 7054], "alt-change": [718, 0], "avg-grade": 47.0, "max-grade": 103.0}},
