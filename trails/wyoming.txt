Little attention was paid to this part of the park for the next 50 years. Then, in 1920, Congress considered damming the Falls and Bechler rivers and turning Bechler Meadows into a reservoir. Western water interests, fresh from victories over damming the Hetch Hetchy in Yosemite (1913) and completing Jackson Lake Dam (1916) had high hopes of success. A bill even passed the U.S. Senate. To combat this attack on Yellowstone, National Parks Association member, William Gregg, made extensive explorations of the waterfalls in the southwest corner of the park in effort to publicize the beauty and value of the area. His articles in magazines like the Saturday Evening Post, together with opposition from Yellowstone Superintendent Horace Albright, carried the day and no dam was constructed. \r\n\nAt the 1.5 -mile mark the cutoff trail leaves Bechler Meadows and enters the forest for the last 1.2 miles before ending at a junction with the Boundary Creek Trail.

To reach the Canoe Lake trailhead, one must first work their way 7.5 miles along the Lamar River Trail, then take an additional 7.9 miles on the Miller Creek Trail. This makes the round-trip mileage to Canoe Lake and back almost 40 miles. It is possible to continue east out of the park along the National Forest Service's Timber Creek Trail and reach the Sunlight Basin Road. But that too is a totals 40 miles. \r\n\nFrom the trailhead on the Miller Creek Trail, the Canoe Lake Trail climbs steeply up an open ridge, gaining 700 feet in the first mile. After that, it levels a bit and enters the forest for several miles. The trail parallels the Calfee Creek as it leads to Canoe Lake, but is well above the water for most of the way and there are infrequent views. The last mile, the trail begins to break out of the trees and affords nice views of the surrounding area. \r\n\nThe trail to Canoe Lake follows one part of the old Bannock Trail. From 1840 to 1878 this 200-mile trail was used by Bannock, Shoshone and Nez Perce Indians to traverse Yellowstone and reach the rich buffalo hunting grounds to the east, in Montana and Wyoming. The trail used a number of passes through the rugged Absaroka Range. Historians believe that a pass near this area may have been used by the Nez Perce in 1877 in their fighting retreat from the US Cavalry. Native American's use of the trail may have had a role in the naming of Canoe Lake. \r\n\nAt the 3.75 mile mark Canoe Lake is reached. The lake itself is quite small, but scenic.

After a mile, the trail breaks out of the forest and enters beautiful DeLacy Meadows. Walter DeLacy entered what is now Yellowstone in 1863 searching for gold. He did not find any, but he did discover Shoshone Lake. He liked it so much he named it for himself DeLacy Lake. In 1872 a member of the second Hayden Survey of Yellowstone officially named it Shoshone Lake after the Indians who frequented the lake. An early park official felt sorry for DeLacy and named this creek after him.\r\n\nFor several miles the trail skirts the eastern side of the meadows affording nice views. The meadow grows wider as it approaches the lake. At the 3-mile mark the trail reaches the lake and a junction with the North Shore Shoshone Lake Trail which branches to the right. Shoshone Lake, at 8,050 acres, is the second largest lake in the park and is the largest backcountry lake in the lower 48. Here, and along the beach to the right, are some of the finest views hikers can get of the lake, which is best experienced by canoe. Many day trippers enjoy themselves in this area and turn around here.\r\n\nThe DeLacy Creek Trail continues straight, enters the trees, and begins a 4.3 mile up and down roller coaster trip along the eastern shore of Shoshone Lake.

The last mile of the trail travels through an area heavily burned by the 1988 fires, but is now rejuvenating. The trail ends at its junction with the South Shore Shoshone Lake Trail and the Dogshead Trail. Nearby is a backcountry patrol cabin and a campsite.

This under appreciated trail closely follows beautiful Fan Creek as it winds its way up through a series of narrow meadows. The creek was named by early geologists who believed its numerous forks divided seven radial ridges into the shape of a fan.\r\n\nAlong the first part of the trail, Fan Creek supports a healthy population of willows, which provide excellent moose habitat. Watch closely, although the moose is the largest member of the deer family and commonly attains a weight of 900 pounds, here among the willows their large dark bodies quickly appear and disappear. The name \"moose\" comes from an Algonquin Indian term meaning \"twig eater.\" These curious-looking creatures are highly specialized for this aquatic habitat. Their long legs allow them to move more freely about the marsh and feed on the leaves, bark and twigs of the willows.\r\n\nAfter about a mile, the trail climbs 100 feet, passes the Fan Creek Campsite Trail, and drops to a ford of Fan Creek (at 1.6 miles). There is no bridge here and the creek can be thigh-deep until mid-July. Take note that this spring-fed creek runs fairly high even into August. You may see anglers in the area pursuing illusive 9-10 inch cutthroat and rainbow trout.\r\n\nThe next 2 miles of the trail are my favorite, as it follows an embankment just above the creek. Views up and down the narrow valley are excellent. Notice how the creek twists and turns. Over time it has changed course and left behind scars on the land, even a number of small oxbow lakes. At 3.6 miles a good-sized unnamed tributary is crossed. Just to the left is the 2nd of 3 excellent campsites found on Fan Creek. \r\n\nFrom here the creek gets smaller, the valley and meadows get narrower, and the trail begins to gain a bit more elevation. At 5.2 miles you pass a large meadow where the North Fork and East Fork of Fan Creek combine. Nearby is the 3rd Fan Creek campsite. The less scenic last 2 miles of the trail follow the North Fork, crossing it at the 6.7-mile mark, before ending at a junction with the Sportsman Lake Trail.\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

At that point, it breaks out into big open meadows and provides a glimpse of what's ahead. Below to the right is willow-lined Duck Creek, a fisherman favorite. Its deep holes hold a healthy population of large brown and rainbow trout. The trail drops almost 200 feet over the next mile to a crossing of Campanula Creek. The creek was named for the harebell flower, scientific name \"Campanula.\" Look around - in July and August you'll see examples of the tiny blue-purple, bell-shaped flowers hanging down from a single stem.\r\n\nThe trail continues to the southeast and enters the main meadows. To the west, the impressive Henrys Lake Mountains begin to come into view. At 4.5 miles, the Gneiss Creek campsite is passed and at 5.1 miles, the trail crosses Gneiss Creek. Gneiss (pronounced \"nice\") is a granite-like metamorphic rock that typically has a banded appearance. Early geologists found outcropping of this 2.5 billion year old rock near the headwaters of this stream. The trail climbs 150 feet in the next 1.5 miles, then drops to a crossing of Maple Creek at the 7.1-mile mark. \r\n\nSouth of Maple Creek, the trail travels through forest that continue to show significant effects from the 1988 fires.

Just to reach the trailhead, one must first work their way out 7.5 miles along the Lamar River Trail, an additional 7.9 miles on the Miller Creek Trail, and a short 0.7 mile section of the Bootjack Gap Trail. But many believe it is worth the effort! \r\n\nFrom the trailhead, the trail immediately fords Miller Creek. By mid-July it's usually an easy less-than-knee-high affair. You should fill your water bottles here, since water becomes scarce as you gain elevation. From Miller Creek the trail switchbacks steeply up and open ridge, gaining 1000 feet in the first 1.5 miles. Thereafter, it moderates, but only slightly, gaining another 1000 feet in the next 3.5 miles. The higher you climb, the more spectacular the views of the high Absaroka Range become. \r\n\nThe rugged Absaroka Mountains (pronounced \"AB-sa-RO-ka\" or \"ab-SAR-o-ka\"), which comprise the eastern boundary of Yellowstone, are named for the Crow Indians who inhabited this region. \"Absaroka\" (which means \"children of the large beaked bird\") is the Crow Indians' name for themselves. These mountains are volcanic in origin. Between 50 and 55 million years ago a myriad of volcanos erupted, sometimes violently, spewing hot molten lava, breccias, rock bombs, cinders and ash. At the end of the Absaroka volcanism, Yellowstone was buried beneath several thousand feet of volcanic debris. Millions of years of subsequent geologic activity have obscured much. Today, the Absaroka Range is a remnant of the vast pile of volcanic rocks that once covered Yellowstone. \r\n\nAt the 4.75 mile mark you reach the top of your big climb and the views are spectacular. Immediately to the south lies 10,203 foot Parker Peak, named for William Parker. He accompanied park Superintendent P.W. Norris on one of the first explorations in this area. Norris was so taken with Parker's sketches of the gargoyle-like Hoodoos that he included them in his official 1880 Annual Report. \r\n\nFrom this point north of Parker Peak, the trail drops, then regains 500 feet in the next mile, then rambles another mile before reaching the Hoodoo Basin at the 7 mile mark. These weird eroded features were discovered and named in 1870 by Adam \"Horn\" Miller. For many, this is the turnaround point. Others wishing to soak up this high alpine scenery continue another 3 miles in and out of the park and up 800 feet to the trail's terminus at a junction with the NFS Sunlight Creek Trail.\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

The trail is pretty easy going across the valley giving you the chance to really take in the scenery. Once you get to the far East side of the valley, you'll encounter the Pelican Valley Backcountry Patrol Cabin. The small wooden bench in the front is a great place to have a rest, grab some calories and make sure your water is full. \r\n\nOnce you continue on you'll be climbing steadily as you make your way up to Mist Creek Pass. Stay alert and make noise as the vegetation gets quite thick around the trail and I've often seen bear tracks on the trail. Once you get to the top of the pass, the view is spectacular! \r\n\nLooking back to the west and south, you'll see all of the Pelican Valley and Yellowstone Lake. If you look more to the south on a clear day, you can see the Teton Range. This is also one of the few places you'll get cell phone service if you need it. From the top of the pass, continue the decent into a beautiful meadow.

It links the Lamar River Trail with the Hoodoo Basin Trail, the Bootjack Gap Trail, and the Canoe Lake Trail, and it is the only way to reach those trails through Yellowstone. The trail closely follows Miller Creek as it meanders its way up the valley providing nice views of the creek and surrounding area. The trail is well marked, easy to follow, and never too steep. The creek purportedly has a healthy population of native cutthroat trout. But most visitors cruse this 7.9 mile stretch on their way to visit the Hoodoo Basin high up in the Absaroka Range near the park boundary. \r\n\nMiller Creek was named for Adam \"Horn\" Miller, known as \"Montana's Toughest Man.\" Miller came to Montana in 1854 searching for gold. He first traveled through Yellowstone in 1864 and in 1870 he staked a claim on the Shoo Fly Mine, near Cooke City. In 1877, Miller guided newly appointed Park Superintendent P. W. Norris through the park. Norris later named this creek in his honor.     \r\n\nKeep a sharp eye out for evidence of fossilized trees. After a couple of miles, look for small pieces of petrified wood on the trail. Watch for outcroppings of brown dirt above the trail on the left. You'll pass a number of fossilized trees standing upright in the dirt. Also, as you continue, watch for specimens each time a tributary creek flows down from the left. \r\n\nAround 55 million years ago, Yellowstone entered a volcanically-active phase. Ashes, mud flows, and breccia from the Absaroka Range entombed the trees that were thriving in this area. As the volcanic matter cooled, cracks formed and water seeped through. This water picked up silica from the surrounding rock and was then soaked up by the tree material, causing the silica to be deposited in each dead tree cell. Over thousands of years the tree decayed away entirely, leaving only the hard rock behind. Please remember, collecting specimens is absolutely forbidden!\r\n\nAt the 7.9 mile mark Miller Creek Trail terminates as it reaches a trail junction with the Canoe Lake Trail and the Bootjack Gap Trail.\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

Most hikers camp at the lake the night before climbing Sheridan. You'll need an early start to beat the afternoon thunderstorms. This is especially true if you plan to hike out of the backcountry the same day.\r\n\nMount Sheridan (10,308') looms over Heart Lake. Its only 2.8 miles to the top, but it towers 2,800 feet above the lake and provides a challenge to even the hardiest hiker. The trailhead is located 200 yards south of the Rustic Geyser area. As you begin the hike, scan the skyline to locate the fire lookout station which marks the top of the mountain. This impressive mountain was named for General Philip H. Sheridan, a civil war veteran who later commanded U.S. military forces in the West during the Indian wars. General Sheridan was one of the first conservationists to call for significant southern and eastern expansions of Yellowstone and strongly influenced the decision to send military troops to protect the park in the 1880s.\r\n\nThe Mount Sheridan Trail winds its way up a ridge and assaults the mountain from the north. As you near the top, the trail breaks out of the trees and the views truly become spectacular. Heart Lake spreads out at your feet. The Tetons seem close enough to touch. Shoshone and Lewis lakes, as well as much of Yellowstone Lake, unfold before you.\r\n\nThe fire lookout station on top of the mountain is one of four such stations in Yellowstone. Some bizarre things have happened to rangers who occasionally occupy these stations. In 1973, Barry Nateman, stationed here on Mount Sheridan, was struck by lightning. His hair turned white and he was thrown a short distance, but somehow he survived. Not to be outdone, the lookout ranger on Mount Holmes was relaxing in the \"outhouse\" when a big wind came up and blew him and it down the side of the mountain! Once you have enjoyed your stay, retrace your steps to the trailhead. Enjoy your afternoon, but remember, it's a good climb from Heart Lake to the highway.\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

This up-and-down trail penetrates Yellowstone's Cascade Corner and provides access to some of Yellowstones most impressive waterfalls.\n\nThe trail leaves the dam and follows the southwest side of the Grassy Lake outlet and then the Falls River over level terrain for the first 1.1 miles. The trail then crosses the Falls River on a tricky, swift, cold, 40-foot, knee-deep ford. The southwest corner of Yellowstone is the wettest, receiving almost 70 inches of precipitation a year. The Falls River and its tributaries drain this Cascade Corner of the park. Just 15 miles downstream this river is a raging torrent over 200 feet across, rivaling even the mighty Yellowstone River. Fur trappers in the 1830s, familiar with this important Snake River tributary, named it \"The Falling Fork\" in recognition of its many falls and cascades.  \n\nShortly after the ford, the trail passes the Pitchstone Plateau Trail on the right, leaves the Falls River drainage, and ascends 250 feet, then drops 130 feet, only to regain it.

The 17.7 mile trail ends at a junction with the Mountain Ash Creek Trail a mile from Grassy Lake Reservoir, 10 miles west of Flagg Ranch on the gravel Flagg Ranch to Ashton, Idaho NFS road (sometimes called the Grassy Lake Road).\r\n\nThe trail begins with a hardy 320-foot ascent of the eastern edge of the plateau in the first 1/2 mile. It continues climbing (less steeply) through a forest heavily burned by the 1988 fires, gaining another 350 feet over the next 4 miles. At the 4.8-mile mark the first point of interest is reached  Phantom Fumarole, which is a small thermal area. This spot is mostly dry, with a few steam vents (called fumaroles) and mud pots. The trail continues southwest and passes several campsites at the 6-mile mark. Freshwater springs in the area make this the only reliable late summer water source on the plateau. \r\n\nSoon the trees become more sparse, and you enter ever larger open meadows, and the trail becomes less distinct on the ground. Watch closely for the chain of rock cairns that mark your way. Watch also for the unusual low rock ribs that punctuate the meadows. These are folds or ripples in the solidified volcanic lava flow that lies just under the surface. The thin layer of topsoil may also be the cause of the stunted tree-growth in the area.\r\n\nA brief geology lesson is in order. The most recent Yellowstone caldera welled-up and blew-out some 630,000 years ago, leaving a giant crater or caldera in the center of Yellowstone. Over time, more than 30 volcanic lava flows erupted and flowed out across the land, filling up the crater. The Pitchstone Plateau, which formed just 70,000 years ago is the youngest lava flow in the park. Other evidence of this lava flow are the many pieces of shiny black and brown volcanic rock in the area. These are pieces of glass-like obsidian and similar, but more-coarse, pitchstone, for which the plateau is named.      \r\n\nThe trail makes a large bend to the right and climbs 150 feet to its highpoint at the 9-mile mark. Here the views are spectacular! To the south, the mighty Tetons lie at your feet. To the north, the unusual open meadows that crown the Pitchstone unfold before you. From here the trail bends back to the left, reenters the trees, and gradually drops 1,700 feet over the last 8 miles to its end at a junction with the Mountain Ash Creek Trail.\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

The only time it strays from the clear-cut used to demarcate the boundary is to avoid several small lakes and marshy meadows.  \n\nThe first and most interesting diversion begins just .6 miles from the trailhead, as the trail travels south of Tanager Lake and a lovely meadow to its west. The area surrounding 30-acre Tanager Lake is quite marshy and the lake itself is very shallow. It was named for the Western Tanager, a strikingly beautiful small bird with an orange-red head, brilliant yellow body, and black wings. \n\nOnce back on the south boundary, the trail continues straight west with few diversions. Because the path was made to mark the boundary and not for hikers convenience it sometimes climbs steeply for short distances. At the 5.1-mile mark the trail skirts south of South Boundary Lake. At the 6.8-mile mark it crosses the Beula Lake Trail.

The trail is divided into three sections. The first is this 12.6-mile section from the South Entrance to Harebell Patrol Cabin. \r\n\nThe trailhead for the South Boundary Trail: South Entrance-Harebell lies just north of the South Entrance Gate at the Snake River Picnic Area. It begins with a big, potentially dangerous, ford. The Snake River here is braided and must be crossed in several sections. The last section is the main channel and it can be very deep. It usually is unfordable until August, and even then can be waist-deep. Visitors intent on taking the South Boundary Trail before the Snake subsides can begin their journey 3 miles south of the park off the Shelfield Creek Road, on the left just past the highway crossing of the Snake. An unmarked route leads north from there along the Snake and picks up the South Boundary Trail on the east side of the river.\r\n\nThe Snake's name comes from sign language used to describe the Snake or Shoshone Indians. They were excellent basket weavers and the sign for their name was a serpentine movement of the hand as if weaving.\r\n\nOnce past the ford, the trail bends left and travels through thermally affected areas. Not far away, the Lewis River flows into the Snake. The trail parallels the Snake River but stays mostly in the trees for the first 5.1 miles. It then breaks out and makes a bridged crossing of a large, very hot thermal runoff channel. Its source is Snake Hot Springs, just ahead to the right of the trail. The scenery is quite nice as the trail nears the Snake. There are several campsites in the area. \r\n\nAt the 6-mile mark the trail passes a junction with the Heart Lake Trail, begins a big bend to the right, and rolls up and down through a large forest fire burned area. At 8.8 miles, the trail passes the Snake River Cutoff Trail and enters a nice mile-long meadow. At 10.1 miles, the trail drops to a knee-high crossing of Coulter Creek just south of its confluence with the Snake. From here, the trail climbs over 500 feet through the trees in the next 1.5 miles and continues over rolling terrain the last mile to the Harebell Patrol Cabin on Harebell Creek.\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

The trail ends at its intersection with the Dogshead Trail shortly after fording the Lewis River Channel on the southeast corner of Shoshone Lake. \n\nIn spite of the trails name, other than the beginning and very end, the trail does not follow the shore. In fact, the trail travels well south of the lake and affords very few views at all. It's primarily used by hikers traveling from Old Faithful to Lewis Lake and through-hikers on the Continental Divide Trail that follows this route.\n\nThe first .9 miles the trail parallels the western shore of Shoshone Lake and affords nice views across a small marshy meadow. Along the way, youll pass a nice campsite on the lake. Thereafter the trail leaves the lake, enters the forest, and begins to climb. It rambles, then climbs more steeply, gaining 500 feet and reaching the trails high point at the 2.1 mile mark. Here you are at the north end of the Pitchstone Plateau, one of Yellowstones youngest lava flows, which occurred just 70,000 years ago.\n\nThe South Shore Trail is part of the Continental Divide Trail (CDT), a National Scenic Trail running 3,100 miles between Mexico and Canada. Look for heavily laden through-hikers, usually traveling the opposite direction. The CDT follows the Rocky Mountains and traverses five U.S. states  New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana. The CDT enters Yellowstone from the south along the Snake River, then passes north of Heart and Lewis lakes, before reaching this section of the trail. It continues to Old Faithful, then leaves the park to the west along the Summit Lake Trail.\n\nFrom its high point, the South Shore Trail gradually loses 150 feet as it makes its way to a ford of Moose Creek (knee-deep till mid July) at the 6-mile mark. At the 7.3-mile mark the trail passes a lovely meadow where Moose Creek flows into Shoshone Lake. At the 8.8-mile mark the Lewis River Channel is reached. This wide, but slow-moving channel can pose a challenge for hikers until mid-July. After the ford, the trail continues north along the lake shore passing a junction with the Lewis River Channel Trail at 8.9 miles and ending at 9.1 miles where it intersects the DeLacy Creek Trail and the Dogshead Trail. The shortest route out is the 4.8 mile Dogshead Trail. For a more scenic exit, take the 6.4 mile Lewis River Channel Trail.\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

It ends at an overlook of the Terraced Falls Trail.\r\n\nThe first 3/4 miles of the Terraced Falls Trail closely follow well-named Cascade Creek as it tumbles down 140-feet to join the Falls River. Along the way, you can see 5 lovely cascades with fanciful suggested names, in order: Pothole Cascades (40 feet); Diamond Cascade (15 feet); Humpback Cascade (15 feet); and two-sectioned Cleft  Cascade (20 feet). \r\n\nAfter Cascade Creek flows into the Falls River the trail follows it northwest and passes well-named Cascade Acres at the 1-mile mark. This beautiful, wide cascade falls a total of 50 feet. At the 1.5-mile mark, the trail ends at a nice overlook of Terraced Falls.

The trail may be difficult to find in places, so watch closely for trail markers and signs of the trail on the ground. At the .3-mile mark, the trail crosses a small unnamed creek. It continues to the .7-mile mark and crosses another small creek. At the 1-mile mark, the trail begins to climb more steeply and at 1.9 miles tops out the 840-foot climb.

The lake sits at the base of a geologic \"cirque,\" a semicircular hollow or amphitheater eroded in the mountain by glaciers. From the lake, there are good views of the top of Mount Holmes.

You should use a sounding pole to maintain balance and avoid holes.\r\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

This is one of two trails from Yellowstone to Bridger Lake, and the route I like best. \r\n\nHeading southwest from the Thorofare Trail the trail fords braided Thorofare Creek beginning at .7 miles. Here above its confluence with the Yellowstone River, Thorofare Creek rivals the Yellowstone in size. Although large, it is usually not a problem to ford by mid-July. There are several nice campsites in the area. At the 1.7-mile mark, the trail leaves Yellowstone and enters Bridger-Teton National Forest (and the trail designation switches to NFS Trail #060).\r\n\nIn the 1820s and 30s, fur trappers seeking beaver pelts followed Native American trails through this area, up the Thorofare, and along the eastern shore of Yellowstone Lake. Joseph Meek, Osborne Russell, and Jim Bridger are some of the best known trappers of the day. Jim Bridger is perhaps best known for his tall tales. Trappers had little for entertainment but talk. Verbal embellishment became a fine art as they related their experiences. Tradition links Bridger\u2019s name with many of Yellowstone's tallest tales, for example claiming that Yellowstone\u2019s petrified forest was carpeted with petrified grass, populated with petrified animals, and even contained birds petrified in flight.\r\n\nThe trail ends at the southwest corner of beautiful Bridger Lake. The large placid pool is in a spectacular setting, directly below Hawk\u2019s Rest to the south, not far from the confluence of Thorofare Creek and the Yellowstone River to the north, and hemmed in by The Trident and Two Ocean Plateau to the east and west. Enjoy this special spot.\r\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

The trailhead is located at the visitor center parking lot and is shared with the Tower Trail. \r\n\nAs you leave the trailhead, you'll wander through thinning ponderosa pine forest with views of the tower to your left. The trail passes through an open area and begins to contour the hillside around to the east.

The trail now begins a continuous descent of the south-facing aspect through meadows and occasional stands of ponderosa.\r\n\nAt about the 0.75 mile mark, you'll come to a junction with South Side Trail.

Once you've had a chance to take in the sights here, continue past a junction with the Joyner Ridge - Red Beds Connector at mile 1.6 and begin the steep ascent back into the forest.

At the pass, the trail connects to the Mountain Creek Trail and enters Yellowstone National Park. The trailhead described here lies just east of Eagle Creek Campground (6 miles east of Yellowstone\u2019s East Entrance), between the campground and the \"official\" trailhead (used primarily by horse parties and which has no bridge to cross the North Fork). There is a small turnaround here and foot suspension bridge that leads to a number of private cabins (please respect their privacy). To also avoid fording Eagle Creek, it is possible to use the footbridge across the North Fork located in the campground.\r\n\nCross the footbridge and take an immediate right turn on a dirt road. Continue .3 miles and ford Eagle Creek. Thereafter, turn left and follow the trail that parallels Eagle Creek. In less than a mile you enter the Washakie Wilderness Area. The trail climbs 350 feet over the first 3 miles and affords nice views of Eagle Creek as it churns its way down. At 3.1 miles the trail makes the first of two crossings of the creek. The second crossing is about a mile up river. It is possible to avoid these two fords by continuing along the west side of the creek.\r\n\nThe trail continues climbing, closely following the creek and at 7 miles crosses good-sized Cabin Creek. At 7.9 miles the trail crosses Eagle Creek for good and a mile later enters beautiful Eagle Creek Meadows. For the next 2.5 miles the trail skirts the southeastern edge of the meadow, affording spectacular views up the meadow to snow-capped Mount Schurz, which marks Yellowstone's eastern boundary. At 10.3 miles the trail veers south, leaves the meadow, and enters the trees. The trail continues along a southern tributary of Eagle Creek, gently climbing until the 13-mile mark. At that point, the trail turns left and steeply climbs 1500 feet in the final 2 miles to the pass.\r\n\nEagle Pass may have been used as early as 1837 by fur trapper Osborne Russell to access the Thorofare. High in the rugged Absaroka Mountains at an elevation of almost 9500 feet, views from the pass are superb! Eagle Peak (11,358), Yellowstone\u2019s highest, dominates the skyline to the west. Views to the south down Howell Creek to the Trident are also outstanding. To the east is a shoulder of Pinnacle Mountain. To the north are impressive views of your route to the pass.\r\n\nThe trail ends at the pass and connects to the Mountain Creek Trail. It\u2019s another 10 miles to the Thorofare Trail.\r\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

Lodgepoles have an unusual way of coping with fire. Besides their annual seed cones, they produce a special \u201cserotinous cone,\u201d which only opens at temperatures that exceed 113\u00b0 F. Following the 1988 fires, up to a million seeds per acre were found on the ground. Some seeds survived the appetites of birds and rodents to produce an abundance of lodgepole saplings. In some places they grew so thick they\u2019re called \u201cdog-hair\u201d forest. Paintpot Hill ahead on the horizon is such a place; notice the thick, green blanket of trees that covers it. \r\n\nAs you continue, notice also the dead trees on the left with white bottoms that look as if they are wearing white anklet socks. These \u201cbobby socks\u201d trees were not killed by fire, but rather drowned by thermal runoff water. The trees soaked up the mineral-laden water, and when the water evaporated, the minerals were left behind, turning the lower portion of the trees white.\r\n\nAt the junction, follow the boardwalk to the left. Notice the hot springs near the bottom of the hill. Most of the time, they have a good water supply. As you climb up the hill water is more limited and the pools are filled with mud. In early summer, the mudpots are thin and watery from abundant rain and snow. By late summer they are quite thick. The mud is composed of clay minerals and fine particles of silica. In this area the rock is rhyolite, which is composed primarily of quartz and feldspar. Acids in the steam and water break down the feldspar into a clay mineral called kaolinite. Iron oxide stains the white mud into a colorful array of pastels. This effect reminded early Yellowstone geologists of an artist\u2019s palette, hence the name \u201cArtists\u2019 Paintpots.\u201d\r\n\nFrom the top of the hill, one gets a great view of the surrounding area including Mount Holmes, that dominates the skyline to the north. \r\n\nSoon, the trail loops back to the right and continues down to the parking area.\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

At the .4-mile mark, the trail enters a series of switchbacks and steeply climbs 300 feet in the next .2 miles, levels a bit, then climbs another 200 feet, reaching the trail highpoint at the 1.6-mile mark. As you climb the hill think about this \u2013 following the 1988 forest fires, pictures of this hill were splashed across newspapers and TV screens. A previous forest fire had left this area with a lot of dead snags and fallen logs. When the 1988 fires ripped through here, there was plenty of dry, dead fuel to burn. This \u201ctwice-burned\u201d hill had a devastated, moon-scape appearance. The news media had a feeding frenzy, combing the hill for best angle to make the fires look as destructive as possible. Their pictures, together with fire-burned acreage totals, gave many Americans the false impression that Yellowstone had been completely torched.\r\n\nFrom the top of the ridge, the trail steeply switchbacks 300 feet back down the ridge and reaches beautiful Grizzly Lake at 2.1 miles. Grizzly is a gorgeous 135 acre narrow lake tucked tightly between two ridges. It has a maximum depth of 36 feet and sports a healthy population of brook trout. The trail rounds the lake's northern tip and crosses its outlet, Straight Creek (look for a spot to cross on the logjam if you don\u2019t want to get your feet wet).

The yellow color from the sulfur combines with the water\u2019s reflected blue light, making the hot spring appear a magnificent emerald green.\r\n\nContinue through the trees and start down the hill. Soon you reach Steamboat Geyser, the world's tallest active geyser. Its major eruptions shoot water more than 300 feet. Observe the massive area this amazing geyser affects. It\u2019s unlikely you'll see a full eruption, but even Steamboat's more frequent 10 to 40-foot micro-bursts exceed many other geysers in size. Further down the hill is Cistern Spring. Steamboat Geyser and Cistern are linked underground. During a major eruption of Steamboat, the water in Cistern's pool drains. Normally, Cistern is a beautiful blue pool from which water continually overflows.\r\n\nNear Cistern, the trail divides. To the right the Back Basin Connector can be used to reduce the trail from 1.6 miles to .9 miles. [Note: As springs shift and grow, the boardwalks are often rerouted to protect the features. Look carefully around the basin, you'll see the scars where boardwalks used to be.] The main trail continues left across Steamboat's runoff channel. At the .4-mile mark is Echinus (e-KI-nus) Geyser. Echinus is the largest acid-water geyser known. Its waters are almost as acidic as vinegar with a pH around 3.5. For years this crowd-pleaser erupted every 35 to 75 minutes. More recently, Echinus eruptions are extremely rare. Like other geysers and hot springs, Echinus can change without warning. \r\n\nThe trail sweeps right, then back left, to visit Puff \u2018n Stuff Geyser and Green Dragon Spring at .8 miles. Steam often fills Green Dragon\u2019s cavern, forcing visitors to wait patiently to glimpse its sulfur-lined cave and boiling green water. The trail then turns back to the north and cuts across the Back Basin, passing Porkchop Geyser, Pearl Geyser, and a personal favorite, Vixen Geyser. Even the smaller geysers are fun to watch and worth a wait. They each have a personality of their own. \r\n\nThe trail passes a junction with the Back Basin Connector (on right), a shorter but steeper route back. Continue straight to see Palpitator Spring, Fearless Geyser, Monarch Geyser, and the remains of Minute Geyser.

There you\u2019ll find a parking lot and the trailhead for the Fountain Flat Drive Trail. Follow this old freight road south .4 miles. Just after crossing the Firehole River, the Sentinel Meadows Trail turns off to the right. \r\n\nThe mostly level trail begins along the Firehole River, one of the nations top blue ribbon fisheries. It sports healthy populations of rainbow and brown trout and whitefish. The trail quickly makes a bridged crossing of tiny Fairy Creek and continues through areas heavily burned by the 1988 fires. Soon the trail begins paralleling Sentinel Creek. About .9 miles from Fountain Flat Drive, the trail tops a small rise and affords nice views of Sentinel Meadows and valley. Notice the three white mounds equally spaced across the valley. The meadows was named for these features \u2013 Steep Cone, Flat Cone, & Mound Springs \u2013 which to an 1872 geologist appeared \u201cas if they were guarding the upper valley.\u201d Hence, the name \u201cSentinel\u201d Meadows. \r\n\nAt 1.3 miles, the trail makes another small rise and provides closer views of the springs. It then bears left and continues to skirt the marshy meadow.  Soon you'll see a small log structure near a hot spring area to the right of the trail. This is the Queens Laundry! In 1880 workers building a road over the Madison Plateau (across the valley to the northwest) spied the beautiful spring and on their Sunday off came down to explore. They found it great for bathing and washing their clothes. A year later, Park Superintendent Norris began construction of a bath house for visitors to use to change clothes to bath in the spring. Although never finished, it has the distinction of being the first government building for public use in any national park. Important safety tip \u2013 the spring is much hotter today than it was in 1880 making bathing and washing impossible (as well as illegal). \r\n\nThe trail continues along the edge of the meadow and ends at its junction with the Imperial Meadows Trail. If you plan to visit Queens Laundry, there is just about no way to reach it without getting your feet wet in the marshy muck.

Park Superintendent Norris believed that construction of roads through Yellowstone would be a great benefit. Not only would \"teeming throngs of tourists, enticed by the bracing air, the healing bathing-pools, and matchless beauties of the 'wonder land',\" be encouraged to come, but opening a route through the park would reduce the government\u2019s cost of supplying the chain of military posts in the west and promote settlement in the nearby areas and assist with the \"Indian question.\" In 1878, Norris took \"some 20 well-armed, mounted, equipped, resolute, and reliable mountaineer laborers\" to build a road up the Mammoth Hot Springs terraces and through a pass into the Swan Lake Flats and on to the Upper Geyser Basin.\r\n\nUnfortunately, other than that bit of history, there is little to recommend taking this trail. Much of the trail follows the former road-bed and later added power lines. The trail travels near or through a number of mostly dry, acidic thermal areas, including Amphitheater Springs near the north end and Whiterock Springs near the midpoint. But Yellowstone has far more interesting backcountry thermal basins to visit.\r\n\nFrom the northern trailhead the trail quickly passes Amphitheater Springs (on the right). That strange lime-colored creek flowing out of the area is known as Lemonade Creek. The trail then climbs, sometimes steeply, up 400 feet in the first mile. As the trail nears the top of the hill it joins the power line service road, which it follows up and down on a fairly straight path for almost 2 miles. Due to downed trees and new growth following a forest fire it is exceedingly difficult to reach Lake of the Woods, which the trail passes. \r\n\nAt the 2.8-mile mark the trail passes through Whiterock Springs (mostly dry). From there the trail follows Solfatara Creek (as it flows south to join the Gibbon River) for the final 4 miles and ends at Norris Campground. Along the way, it passes through some nice wildflower meadows and a junction with the Howard Eaton Trail (on the right at the 6.1-mile mark).\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

Head through the museum, pass Campground Trail (on right) Back Basin Trail (on left), and head down the hill. Continue straight at the next junction (on left, our trail's return route).\r\n\nNorris is the hottest, most changing thermal area in Yellowstone. White colored mineral deposits in the basin inspired the name Porcelain Basin. Siliceous sinter is brought to the surface by hot water and forms a \"sheet\" over this flat area as the water flows across the ground and the mineral settles out. Siliceous sinter is an important agent of change. If it seals off a hot spring by accumulating in its vent, the hot, pressurized water may flow underground to another weak area and blow out.\r\n\nGoing down the hill, observe the thermal area on the left. Most days you see and hear Black Growler. The hottest of Yellowstone's geothermal features are steam vents, or fumaroles. Black Growler\u2019s super-heated steam measures 199 to 280 degrees F. A plentiful water supply would cool these features; but, steam vents are usually found on higher ground, above the water supply. They rapidly boil away the limited water, forcefully releasing steam. If you are extremely lucky you may also see an eruption of Ledge Geyser. It is capable of shooting water 125 feet into the air. Because it erupts at an angle, the water sometimes reaches the ground 220 feet away.\r\n\nContinue straight at the junction and follow the boardwalk out across the basin. Soon you reach Whirligig and Little Whirligig geysers. Whirligig was so named because its water swirls in its crater during eruptions. The orange-yellow iron oxide deposits around Little Whirligig make it one of the most colorful features in Porcelain Basin. \r\n\nAmazingly, living organisms thrive even in the extreme environments of these hot acidic springs! The overflow channels of geysers and hot springs are often brightly colored with minerals and microscopic life forms. Hardy lime-green Cyanidium algae thrive in these waters. Orange cyanobacteria is also found in the runoff streams.\r\n\nThe trail bends left through trees. Emerging, you pass Whale's Mouth, named by park naturalists because its shape \"resembles the mouth and gullet of a giant fish.\" A peculiar thing for a trained naturalist to say, since whales are not fish. Next up is Crackling Lake, named for popping sounds from springs on its southern shore.

Soon, the trail grows steeper and enters a series of switchbacks. Northern switchbacks afford impressive views of Cathedral Rock, the Hoodoos, Terrace Mountain, and the Golden Gate. The large rock outcrop that protrudes from Bunsen Peak was named Cathedral Rock for its \"spire-like forms.\" The rock-slides of gray limestone blocks, beneath you were dubbed \"The Hoodoos,\" because of the rock's ghostly shapes. These travertine blocks are remains of ancient hot spring terraces (similar to Mammoth Hot Springs) that over thousands of years broke away and cascaded down from the top of Terrace Mountain. In the 1880s, a stagecoach road was built following a route similar to the current highway. This impressive feat of engineering, was called the \"Golden Gate\" because of the golden-colored lichens that cover the canyon walls.   \r\n\nBunsen Peak (8564') formed volcanically about 50 million years ago. The peak may be the remains of a volcano that welled up but never blew out, or a small stock that solidified directly beneath a volcano. It is now exposed because erosion has stripped away the lava and volcanic breccia that once completely covered it. The peak was named for Robert Wilhelm von Bunsen, a brilliant German scientist whose name is also attached to the Bunsen Burner you may remember from chemistry. In the 1840s, Bunsen conducted a study of Iceland's geysers and developed a theory on their workings that proved helpful to scientists later studying Yellowstone's geysers.\r\n\nAt the 2-mile mark, you reach the first of Bunsen Peak's three small summits (don't disturb the communication equipment). Beneath you to the west lies Swan Lake Flat and the Gallatin Range. This valley is also known as Gardner's Hole after Johnson Gardner, who trapped beaver here in the 1830s.\r\n\nMost turn around at the summit, but you can continue over the three small summits and follow the well-marked trail another 2 miles, steeply descending more than 1300 feet down the peak's northeastern slope to a junction with the Bunsen Peak Road. From there, to make it a loop hike, continue to the right and follow the Bunsen Peak Road Trail another 3 miles back to the Bunsen Trailhead.\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

At nearly 11,000 feet, Electric is the monarch of northern Yellowstone. From the peak, hardy hikers can see nearly 100 miles in every direction on a clear day - from the Tetons to the south, to the Beartooths in the east, to the Crazys up north, and the Madison Range out west. The views cannot be beat! \r\n\nThe trailhead for the Electric Peak-Southeastern Ridge Trail is 6.2 miles from the Mammoth to Norris Road, and is reached via the Glen Creek Trail. The Electric Peak Trail starts slowly, but ends with a bang. The first 1.2 miles meander through forests and meadows gaining little elevation. Then it breaks out to a dramatic overlook of the Gardiner River. From there, the trail picks up the southeast ridge and closely follows it, ascending nearly 3,000 feet in the next 2.1 miles.\r\n\nFor decades, Electric was thought to be Yellowstone's highest peak. Park maps well into the 1900s showed its elevation as over 11,000 feet. More accurate observations determined the peak to be 10,992 feet above sea level. And further explorations of the rugged Absaroka Range on the park's eastern boundary identified 5 Yellowstone peaks that are higher (however, none are accessible by trail). \r\n\nAt the 2-mile mark, the trail breaks out of the trees for good and the views become grander and grander, and the trail steeper and steeper, each step of the way. At 2.7 miles, notice the change in geology. From here to the top the iron-rich sedimentary rocks take on a decidedly red color. The last .6 miles is a scramble over seemingly endless piles of this rock. Along the way, you cross over the boundary between Wyoming and Montana (most of Yellowstone lies in Wyoming with small portions in Montana and Idaho).This is also the 45th parallel of latitude, halfway between the North Pole and the Equator.\r\n\nIn 1872, members of the second Hayden Survey set out to climb Electric Peak. As they neared the summit the geological party heard a \"crackling noise\" and felt electricity \"so strong that [they] were obliged to . . . hurry down.\" This is how Electric Peak got its name. As you reach the summit, it's doubtful you'll be shocked, but you'll get a strong sensation from the panoramic view that unfolds. There's a sign in box, so you can place your name among those who have reached the top.

From this vantage, hikers get a commanding view of Swan Lake Flat (also known as Gardner\u2019s Hole) to the southeast and nice views of the Gallatin Range to the west. \r\n\nThe trail then bends to the right and drops 170 feet to a knee-high crossing of the Gardner River at 2.5 miles. There are several campsites in the area. Fishing is good for small brook trout on the upper Gardner River, named for Johnson Gardner, who trapped beaver in the area in the 1830s. You may want to keep your water-shoes on, since the trail crosses Fawn Creek in another 400 yards.\r\n\nAt the 2.6-mile mark, the trail passes Fawn Lake Campsite (1F2).

At 8.9 miles, a short spur trail to the left crosses Fawn Creek to reach the Fawn Pass Patrol Cabin. Just before the pass, you\u2019ll see the small lake that is the source of Fawn Creek.\r\n\nFawn Pass is a wide gap in the Gallatins. The views from the pass are nice, and they get even better as you continue west and get views down to the lush green meadows of the Gallatin River drainage ahead on the left. At the 14.1-mile mark, the Fawn Pass-Bighorn Pass Cutoff Trail is passed on the left, giving hikers access to the Bighorn Pass Trail and the Gallatin River. \r\n\nThe Fawn Pass Trail continues through intermittent meadows and follows a small tributary stream leading down the mountain to join Fan Creek. At the 18-mile mark, the trail passes the Fan Creek Trail on the right. Look for moose in the marshy, willow-choked meadows. At 18.5 miles, the Fawn Pass Spur/Bacon Rind TH Trail splits to the right.

Along the way the trail passes many of the most beautiful and historic hot spring terraces in the park. Start the trail at any of 4 parking areas at the base of the terraces. From north to south, the areas are near: (1) the restroom; (2) Liberty Cap; (3) beneath Minerva Spring; and (4) beneath Jupiter Terrace.\r\n\nFrom the restroom parking the trail travels south toward Liberty Cap, a 37-foot tall extent hot spring cone. Just past Liberty Cap the short Palette Springs Spur trail affords nice views of Palette Springs and the Devil\u2019s Thumb.\r\n\nThe trail continues past the 2nd parking area along the road to the 3rd parking area, then turns right and begins climbing into the terraces. The terrace travertine formations are made of calcium carbonate. Beneath lies thick layers of sedimentary limestone, deposited millions of years ago by vast seas. The hot springs water contains dissolved carbon dioxide gases which form a weak carbonic acid. This hot, acidic solution dissolves great quantities of limestone as it works up through rock layers to the surface. Once exposed to the open air, some of the carbon dioxide escapes from solution. As this happens, limestone can no longer remain in solution and it is deposited in these beautiful travertine formations. These deposits can grow very fast - as much three feet a year!\r\n\nAs springs shift and formations grow, the boardwalks are often rerouted to protect the features. Look carefully, you can see the scars where boardwalks used to travel. Soon the trail passes a small connector trail down to the 4th parking area and then bends several times to the right. Above you on the left is Jupiter Terrace. In the 1980s, it flowed so heavily that it overtook boardwalks several times. It has been dry since 1992, but when active, its color and intricate terraces make Jupiter special. Past Jupiter, the Mammoth Terraces Trail Connector (on left) provides a more direct route to the top of the Main Terrace.\r\n\nOur trail continues beneath now-dormant Minerva Spring (a short spur takes you closer) then loops back to the left and climbs above it. The last push to the top of the Main Terrace is a bit steep. But the views from the top are nice. The final leg of the trail continues along the Upper Terrace Drive, past a spur trail overlooking Canary Spring, and ends at a parking area on the main road.\r\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

The trail heads northwest over rolling terrain. The entire area that this trail traverses was heavily burned in the 1988 fires. At 1.1 miles, the trail crosses Winter Creek; if you want to keep your feet dry, look for a log jam up stream. Just past the ford, the trail turns left and follows Winter Creek for the next 4.7 miles through a neat little narrow valley. Look for moose and elk along this section of the trail.\r\n\nAt 2.6 miles, you pass a trail junction (on the left) with the Grizzly Lake Trail. Here Straight Creek (the Grizzly Lake outlet) joins with Winter Creek. Both creeks sport a nice population of brook trout. At the 5.8-mile mark, the trail reaches the Winter Creek Patrol Cabin. Nearby are several backcountry campsites. There is also a trail junction here with the Trilobite Lake Trail (the trail up to the lake leads to the northwest from the rear of the patrol cabin).\r\n\nThe Mount Holmes Trail continues past the cabin, leaves the Winter Creek drainage, and quickly begins to climb. The trail gains more than 2,600 feet in the last 5.4 miles, starting slowly and becoming steeper as you near the top. Mount Holmes was named for geologist/topographer William Holmes, who in 1878 wrote the first detailed geological report on Yellowstone. Mount Homes is the southern terminus of the Gallatin Range, the only non-volcanic, sedimentary rock mountain range in the park. The rocks here formed from the accumulation and consolidation of sea floor sediments. \r\n\nThe trail continues to climb and at the 10-mile mark switchbacks up a saddle connecting the White Peaks (on the left) and Mount Holmes (on the right). The area ahead is the headwaters of Indian Creek. The trail continues to the right climbing 1,000 feet in the last mile or so. From the saddle, topsoil becomes thinner and thinner and soon the trail is traveling over hard rock talus. \r\n\nThe bald top of Mount Homes is reached at 11.2 miles. From here the views in all directions are spectacular. The fire lookout station on top of the mountain is one of four such stations in Yellowstone. In the early 1970s the lookout ranger on Mount Holmes was relaxing in the \"outhouse\" when a big wind came up and blew him and it down the side of the mountain! Notice how well the privy is anchored today! Once you have enjoyed your stay, retrace your steps to the trailhead.\r\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

It begins near Liberty Cap, a 37-foot tall hot spring cone named in 1871 by the first Hayden Survey because of its resemblance to the peaked caps worn during the French Revolution. Its unusual shape was created by a hot spring whose plumbing remained active in one location for a long time. Internal pressure was sufficient to raise the water to a great height, allowing mineral deposits to build continuously for perhaps hundreds of years. Eventually, the spring sealed itself off and the water found another route to the surface. An early Yellowstone superintendent fearing the formation would fall over braced it with timbers. Almost 150 years later, we see that his fear was unfounded!\r\n\nOn the left, past Liberty Cap is beautiful Palette Springs. Water flows from springs above down a steep ridge, creating a colorful hillside palette of brown, green, and orange (the colors are due to the presence of different heat-tolerant bacteria). This effect is much the same as an artist would achieve by allowing wet paint to run down a vertical surface.\r\n\nContinue beyond Palette Springs to the end of the boardwalk.

Since the 1890s, when records were first kept on the activity of Mammoth Hot Springs, Minerva has gone through both active and inactive periods. For several years in the early 1900s, it was completely dry, but by 1951 reports state that Minerva was again active. In recent years, hot spring activity has shifted dramatically from Minerva to other features on the Lower Terraces, and back again.\r\n\nDuring some cycles of activity, water discharge and mineral deposition have been so great that boardwalks have been buried beneath mounds of newly deposited travertine.

The Agate Creek Trail leaves the Specimen Ridge Trail, gradually ascends 500 feet through open sagebrush meadows high above the Yellowstone River before plunging 1300 feet to the Yellowstone near the mouth of Agate Creek.\r\n\nThis seldom-used trail takes curious visitors and eager fishermen to a remote section of the mighty Yellowstone River at the bottom of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone near the canyon's terminus. Here the canyon is covered with trees and does not display multi-colors like it does at the beginning of the canyon some 15 miles up river. But the river and canyon still have a wild sprit and afford adventuresome hikers an intimate experience. \r\n\nOne of America's few northward flowing rivers, the Yellowstone begins a few miles south of the park and travels 670 miles before emptying into the Missouri River near the Montana-North Dakota border. It is the longest undammed river in the continental United States.\r\n\nTo the southwest, the skyline is dominated by Mount Washburn. At the 1.6 mile mark the trail crosses Quartz Creek just before it plunges down an eroded ravine to join the Yellowstone. Soon the trail skirts the edge ridge above the river and views up and down the river are outstanding.  Up river you see into the reaches of the Grand Canyon. Down river you can see a distinctive light-colored rock outcropping towering above the river. This is the Narrows near Tower Falls.\r\n\nThe final 1.4 miles of the trail precipitously drops over 1300 feet. The trail ends at the Yellowstone River near the mouth of Agate Creek.

In the winter, it's part of a great cross-country ski trail from Indian Creek Campground to Mammoth Hot Springs. The first 3 miles of the road is often used by hikers to make a loop in combination with Bunsen Peak Trail up and over Bunsen Peak and back along this road.\r\n\nThe 6.3-mile Bunsen Peak Road Trail begins on the east side of the Mammoth to Norris Road, just south of Rustic Falls. The dirt road rounds the \"backside\" of Bunsen Peak and ends near Mammoth Hot Springs. The first 3.2 miles are mostly level and wander through open meadows frequented by buffalo and elk. To the west are nice views across Swan Lake Flat to the Gallatin Mountains.\r\n\nAt the 3.2-mile mark, the Bunsen Peak Trail joins from the left, the road enters the forest and begins a steep 950-foot descent over the next 2.2 miles. Right after the junction, the road passes Osprey Falls Trail (on the right). That trail leads steeply down into Gardner Canyon to the base of 150-foot Osprey Falls. \r\n\nThe road continues to twist and turn its way down through forests heavily burned by the 1988 fires. That year, the intense North Fork Fire, the largest of eight major fires during that extraordinary summer, roared through this area. As devastated as this forest appeared, by some measures it was more alive than before. The fires opened the overhead canopy and cleared the cluttered forest floor. Within weeks, grasses and other plant life began sprouting and small animals began feeding on the feast of seeds dropped during the fire. Burned trees attracted insects that in turn attracted a variety of birds. Stop and survey the changes that have occurred in the 30 years since the fires. Listen for the sounds of a forest alive. \r\n\nAt the 5.4-mile mark, the road reaches its lowest point as it crosses Glen Creek. From there, the road climbs 175 feet in the last .9 miles. Near the end, the road passes through an employee housing area before reaching the main highway about a mile south of Mammoth Hot Springs.\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

Once the snow melts, there is little available water on this trail. \r\n\nFrom the trailhead, the Sepulcher Trail begins a steady 2,000-foot climb in the first 2.7 miles to the top of the mountain. The trail climbs steeply, zigzagging through open south-facing meadows affording nice views to the south of Swan Lake Flat and the Gallatin Mountains. The wildflowers displays are also impressive in June and early July. The area to the south, known as Gardner\u2019s Hole, is drained by the Gardner River. Both are named for Johnson Gardner, who trapped beaver here in the 1830s. \r\n\nThe top of Sepulcher has more trees than the route up, but there are still nice views to the west of imposing Electric Peak, more than 1,000 feet higher than Sepulcher. Electric Peak was named following an 1872 incident near the summit in which a geological party heard a \u201ccrackling noise\u201d and felt electricity \u201cso strong that [they] were obliged to . . . hurry down.\u201d\r\n\nFrom the highpoint, the trail continues north, then bends right along a steep precipice. Among the craggy rocks below is one that when viewed from Gardiner, Montana more than 4,000 feet below, resembles a tombstone, hence the name Sepulcher Mountain. Notice the town of Gardiner is spelled with an extra \"i\". This is the result of a phonetic error by members of the 1870 Washburn Expedition, who used the \"Gardiner\" spelling in their many articles and publications. As a result, a number of features became erroneously shown on many maps. In the 1940s, the USGS relabeled maps using the correct spelling. Only the town persists in using the \"Gardiner\" spelling.\r\n\nSoon the trail enters its steepest section, falling more than 900 feet in .8 miles. The trail levels briefly, then continues through intermittent forests and meadows and occasional switchbacks. Views of Mammoth Hot Springs and flat-topped Mount Everts are good.

From there, they follow the plowed highway back north .6 miles to a right turnoff toward Sheepeater Cliff Picnic Area. The trail continues along the Gardner River for .3 miles to the picnic area at the base of Sheepeater Cliff. In 1879 Park Superintendent Philestus W. Norris named this cliff, which extends several miles downstream, in honor of the Sheepeater Indians, who once inhabited the area. The Sheepeaters (or \"Tukuarika\" as they called themselves) were a subgroup of the Shoshone Nation. Groups within the Shoshone received subnames according to their economic base. These names included the \"Root-diggers,\" \"Salmon-eaters,\" and \"Sheep-eaters.\" As their name suggests, the Sheepeaters depended primarily on the bighorn sheep for food and clothing. Although their weapons were primitive, their hunting methods were quite accomplished. Using paths bordered by brush fences, they drove animals into a cliff or canyon where others lay waiting in ambush.\r\n\nFrom the picnic area, the ski trail leaves the river, climbs above the cliff, and continues through broken meadows with nice views of the Gallatin Range to the west.

The trailhead for Sportsman Lake Trail is 6.2 miles from the Mammoth to Norris Road, reached via the Glen Creek Trail. The 16-mile trail ends at a junction with the Specimen Creek Trail, about 2.1 miles from Hwy 191. \r\n\nFrom the trailhead, the Sportsman Lake Trail quickly drops to the first of 2 Gardner River crossings (look for a good log to cross). There are several campsites in the area. Due to bear restrictions, there are no other campsites until you reach Sportsman Lake, 7 miles away. The trail climbs gently through the trees to the second crossing at 1.5 miles. The river, which is not difficult to cross by July, is named for Johnson Gardner, who trapped beaver in the area in the 1830s.      \r\n\nAt the 3-mile mark, the trail begins to break out into beautiful open rocky meadows that lead to the pass. Stay alert, in late summer, high mountain meadows like this are excellent for viewing elk, big horn sheep, and grizzly. The trail continues its steady but never difficult climb, then makes its final push to the pass via short switchbacks. From 9785-foot Electric Divide you get your first views to the west toward Sportsman Lake. \r\n\nFrom the divide, the trail drops more than 2000 feet (steeply in places) in the next 3 miles through open meadows then forests to Sportsman Lake. The small, 4-acre lake is in a beautiful setting nestled below rock cliffs. There are several campsites and a petrol cabin in the area. The best view of the lake is from Campsite WD3 (take the short spur trail to the right across the meadow). There\u2019s good fishing for cutthroat trout, hence the name \u201cSportsman\u201d Lake. The rock on the east side is sometimes called Yahoo Rock.\r\n\nThe trail then climbs 600 feet through heavily burned forests in the next 1.6 miles, then drops 400 feet to a crossing of the North Fork of Fan Creek at the 10.3-mile mark (the Fan Creek Trail splits off to the left here). The trail regains 200 feet by the 11-mile mark but it\u2019s all downhill from there, dropping 1000 feet in the final 5 miles. At 11.4 miles the Crescent Lake-High Lake Trail splits to the right. From there, the trail turns left and follows the East Fork of Specimen Creek through a heavily burned ravine to its end at the Specimen Creek Trail, just after crossing the creek.\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

It has commanding views of the area, takes you past a number of interesting hot springs, and provides chances to see animals including bison, elk, and mule deer. Cross-country skiers are advised to follow this loop trail beginning to the left (counter-clockwise) to get the biggest hill out of the way, then enjoy a mostly down-hill trip through the hot spring terraces. Snowshoers will want to travel clockwise, to see the most interesting views and features first. This description follows the clockwise route (turn right at the beginning of the loop trail). \r\n\nTurn right an follow the groomed trail as it traces its course along the Upper Terrace Road through a sparse forest of Rocky Mountain Juniper trees. Soon the trail breaks out and affords commanding across the top of the main hot spring terrace to the Mammoth Hotel (to the left) and Fort Yellowstone (to the right). Fort Yellowstone was originally built by the US Calvary, who were in charge of protecting the park from 1886 until 1916, when the National Park Service was created. \r\n\nIn 2015, Baby Spring reemerged in this area and began overtaking the road! The Mammoth Hot Springs area is highly volatile and the springs here emerge, and dry-up, only to reemerge again. The calcium carbonate deposits brought to the surface by the springs in this area build up very fast, often growing many inches in a single year. This forces the NPS to move the boardwalks and sometimes the road to get out of the way of these natural features.\r\n\nThe trail loops back to the left and climbs a hill passing the remnants of New Highland Terrace on the left.  At the top of the hill the trail rounds beautiful Orange Spring Mound. The trail then meanders past Highland Spring and eventually White Elephant Back Terrace (both on your left) before dropping down 170 feet to complete the loop.\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

The Bunsen Peak Road is open to hikers and cyclists, but no cars. The short 1.2-mile Osprey Falls Trail drops over 700 feet (sometimes steeply) into Sheepeater Canyon to the base of beautiful Osprey Falls on the Gardner River. \r\n\nThe first 1/2 mile the trail travels through burned forests along the top of the canyon. It then begins a series of switchbacks steeply descending into the canyon, dropping 300 feet in the next .4 mile, and then another 350 feet in the following .2 mile. The latter section is some of the steepest trail in Yellowstone.  \r\n\nNotice the unusual rock formation across the Gardner River, which resembles a row of fence posts. This is \"columnar basalt.\" Basalt is a volcanic rock poor in silica but rich in iron and magnesium, which accounts for its dark color. Deep beneath the earth's surface, at temperatures approaching 2200\u00b0 F, basalt is in a liquid state. This cliff is the remains of a basalt lava flow that welled up and spilled onto the surface over 200,000 years ago. The liquid or \"molten\" basalt may have traveled many miles before hardening. As the lava flow cooled, it solidified and contracted, causing it to crack into many-sided columns. The columns were later exposed by river erosion. If you could see the flow's flat upper surface, it would resemble a honeycomb.\r\n\nIn 1879, Park Superintendent Philestus Norris named this Sheepeater Cliff in honor of the Sheepeater Indians, who once inhabited the area. The Sheepeaters (or \"Tukuarika\" as they called themselves) were a subgroup of the Shoshone Nation. As far as we know they were the only Native Americans to make their year-round home in what is now Yellowstone Park. Many tribes, including the Blackfeet, Shoshone, Crow, Bannock and Nez Perce, occupied surrounding areas and entered Yellowstone to hunt, gather obsidian for weapons, and commune with its spiritual powers. However, they apparently found conditions within too harsh for permanent residence. In 1871 (the year before Yellowstone became a park), the Sheepeaters left to join the Eastern Shoshone on the Wind River Reservation, southeast of Yellowstone.\r\n\nThe last .2 miles the trail levels out and follows the Gardner River upstream to the base of 150-foot Osprey Falls. It\u2019s impressive any time of the year, but for a real rush visit Osprey in June, as the snowmelt thunders through the canyon!\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

This whole area was thoroughly burned by the fires of 1988. Although some areas of the park will take 100 years or more to recuperate, meadows like this significantly regenerated the following summer. In 1989, scores of news reporters fanned out across this meadow to photograph the spectacular wildflower display of lupine and fireweed and to tell the story of nature's amazing recuperative powers. Today, only a trained eye can spot any remaining effects of the fire.\r\n\nAbout 0.4 miles from the highway the trail passes a junction with the Blacktail Ponds Spur Trail on the left then climbs a gentle rise. This trail provides fishing access to the ponds and eventually connects with the Lava Creek Trail. Look around for the \"elk exclosures\" in the area. Park biologists use these fenced-in areas to study the effects of Yellowstone's browsing animals on the native vegetation. Although the fenced-in vegetation is clearly taller, biologists found a surprising thing. In some cases grazing decreased plant diversity, as the taller plants shaded-out the shorter species.\r\n\nThe next 1.5 miles take you over beautiful open meadows (excellent for wildflowers). Along the way, passing a junction with the Rescue Creek Trail on the left at the 0.7 mile mark.

Shortly after you begin your descent, listen for a falls on the creek just a few yards to the right (SE) of the trail. This small 20-foot falls is known as \"Hidden Falls.\" Just downstream, notice the rock wall on the opposite side of the creek. It looks like a solid row of fenceposts! This unusual geological formation is called \"columnar basalt.\" Cooling of an ancient lava flow caused the rock to contract and crack into many-sided columns.\r\n\nAbout 4 miles from the trailhead you reach the banks of the mighty Yellowstone River, deep in the heart of the Black Canyon. The trail uses a steel suspension completed in 1936 to cross the river. It was here, near the mouth of Blacktail Deer Creek, that President Teddy Roosevelt camped with naturalist John Burroughs in 1903. In Roosevelt's words, \"It was a very pleasant camp... Where our tents were pitched the bottom of the valley was narrow, the mountains rising steep and cliff-broken on either side.\"\r\n\nOnce across the river the trail scrambles 100 feet up a slope and ends as it joins the Yellowstone River Trail.\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

This 7.1 mile trail links the upper reaches of the Pebble Creek Trail with the Slough Creek Trail. But 9350 foot Bliss Pass is a major destination in itself well worth the time and effort needed to reach it!\r\n\nThe trail is described here starting on the Pebble Creek side, since hiking from east to west the trail gains 1,100 feet less in elevation than coming from the opposite direction. To reach the Bliss Pass Trail from the Pebble Creek side, one must hike 8.7 miles up Pebble Creek (from the Pebble Creek Campground Trailhead) or 5.4 miles down Pebble Creek (from the Warm Creek Trailhead near the Northeast Entrance). Hardy hikers can reach Bliss Pass in a 15 total mile out-and-back from the Warm Creek Trailhead. It's also possible to hike it as a 20-mile trek from the Warm Creek Trailhead through upper Pebble Creek, over Bliss Pass, down Slough Creek, and out at Slough Creek Campground.\r\n\nThe Bliss Pass Trail traverses the mountain ridge that connects Mount Hornaday on the south with Cuttoff Mountain looming ominously to the north. From the trailhead, the trail immediately fords Pebble Creek, which by July is usually not a problem. It then quickly sets to steeply climbing 1,600 feet to the pass. At this lower elevation, trees are a mixed forest of spruce, fur, and lodgepole pine. Soon the trail skirts a fire burn area from the 1988 fires. As you climb higher, the views to the south (Mount Hornaday) and east (upper Pebble Creek) become increasingly good. Near the pass five-needled Limber pine is added to the mix.\r\n\nAt the 2-mile mark, the trail abruptly levels out and the trees become sparse as you reach the eastern side of the pass. Be sure to scramble up the small hill to the right for the best views of upper Pebble Creek which forms a magnificent amphitheater. The snow-clad Beartooth Mountains are also visible to the northeast beyond the park boundary. I thought \"Bliss\" was an appropriate name for such a beautiful pass until I discovered it was named for a local rancher named Bliss.\r\n\nThe trail continues over fairly level terrain and then begins its long descent (2,700 feet) to the beautiful meadows of Slough Creek.

The trail heads north and immediately makes a difficult ford of Slough Creek. Although the water is calm, it\u2019s quite deep! It's not recommended until August. (Another way across Slough Creek is to take the Soldiers Trail from Slough Creek Campground. The ford there is swifter and difficult, but more shallow.) \r\n\nFrom the ford the trail begins a 1300 foot climb to Yellowstone\u2019s northern border. The first section climbing above the First Meadow is quite beautiful. At the 1.2-mile mark the Soldiers Trail joins from the left. As you continue climbing through sagebrush meadows, views of the First Meadow are superb. You also can see the top of rugged Cutoff Mountain to the northeast. \r\n\nAt 2.3 miles the trail reaches the top of the climb's steepest part. Soon the trail enters a spruce-fir forest heavily burned in the 1988 fires. In the canyon below you on the left, Buffalo Creek churns its way south to join Slough Creek. The trail stays above the creek and parallels it for the next 4 miles, then it drops 200 feet to a crossing of Buffalo Creek at the 7-mile mark. Along the way, you cross the boundary between Wyoming and Montana at the 4.3-mile mark (most of Yellowstone lies in WY with small portions in MT and ID) and the 45th parallel of latitude at the 4.5-mile mark, which is halfway between the North Pole and the Equator. At the 6.4-mile mark the trail leaves Yellowstone and enters Custer Gallatin National Forest. \r\n\nThe meadow at the Buffalo Creek crossing is lovely; nearby are good campsites (no reservations necessary in the National Forest). Fishing for rainbow trout on the Buffalo is also good (note a Montana fishing license is required once you leave Yellowstone). At 7.5 miles the trail passes a junction with the Poachers Trail (on left), then continues north closely following Buffalo Creek for 3 miles to the next beautiful meadow with more nice campsites. \r\n\nThe 22.8-mile trail continues for miles along the creek (twice crossing it) and climbing 2100 feet to Boulder Pass.

Most of the park's granite is buried beneath volcanic debris, but glaciers in this northeastern part of the park scraped the debris off in places to expose the underlying granite. \r\n\nThe trail continues through open meadows and stands of Douglas and subalpine fir that show the effects of the 1988 fires. At 3.7 miles the trail makes a small switchback right then left. Here the trail crosses the boundary between Wyoming and Montana (most of Yellowstone lies in WY with small portions in MT and ID). At 5.3 miles a small creek is crossed. This is one of the last reliable sources of water on the trail as you head north. Just past the switchbacks out of the creek drainage a spur trail splits to the left to the only designated campsite on the plateau. \r\n\nAt 7.3 miles the Buffalo Plateau Patrol Cabin is passed. The trail then makes a big bend to the right then back to the left and skirts the plateau highpoint (on your left). At the 8.7 mile-mark the trail ends at a junction with the National Forest Service's Poachers Trail (also called the NFS Buffalo Plateau Trail, #98). The best view in the area is had by scrambling off-trail up the last 200 feet to the plateau highpoint (9478'). From there you get great views of the Absaroka Mountains to the north, the Gallatin Range to the west, the Washburn Range to the south, and the snowy Beartooth Range to the northeast.\r\n\nFor those who want to continue, a left turn leads 11 miles back to the Buffalo Plateau Trailhead (via the Poachers Trail and Coyote Creek Trail). A right turn leads 12 miles to Slough Creek (via the Poachers Trail and Buffalo Fork Trail).\r\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

The Chittenden Road Trail (described here) and the Mount Washburn South Trail (which begins at Dunraven Pass). Both trails follow an old roadbed and gradually climb 1300+ feet. Both afford spectacular views and wonderful wildflower displays. Most visitors however prefer the Mount Washburn South Trail, because the twists and turns of the trail are more dramatic and the views to the south of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, Hayden Valley, and Yellowstone Lake are more interesting.    \r\n\nTo find the trailhead to the Chittenden Road-Mount Washburn Trail, follow the well-marked Chittenden Road for a half-mile or so south and east of the Grand Loop Road to a large parking area. From there, the easy-to-follow dirt road climbs steadily, but never too steeply, through mostly open meadows to the top of 10,243 foot Mount Washburn. \r\n\nThe mountain was named for Henry D. Washburn, Surveyor-General of the Montana Territory and leader of the 1870 Washburn Expedition through Yellowstone. That year General Washburn climbed this mountain to locate the best route to Yellowstone Lake. \"The country before us was a vast basin. Far away in the distance, but plainly seen, was the Yellowstone Lake,\" wrote Washburn.\r\n\nThe first fire lookout station on the summit of Mount Washburn was constructed in 1921. The current station was built in 1940. In 1979, a small Visitor Center was added. Because of its central location, Mount Washburn affords the best possible overall view of the park. General Sherman of Civil War prominence summed it up well when he stated, \"Any man standing on Mount Washburn feels as though the whole world were below him.\" On a cold day it is even possible to make out the steam from an eruption of Old Faithful!\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

To reach the Coyote Creek Trailhead, follow the first 1.5 miles of the Hellroaring Creek Trail to a trail junction, then turn right and follow the Buffalo Plateau Trail another .5 miles to the trailhead.\r\n\nFrom the Coyote Creek Trailhead, the trail begins a slow but steady 1,300 foot climb through beautiful open meadows up the western shoulder of Buffalo Plateau. As its name implies, there is a good chance you\u2019ll see buffalo here. There\u2019s also a good chance to see elk and the trail\u2019s namesake \u2013 coyote. However, Yellowstone\u2019s coyote population has dropped dramatically since wolves were reintroduced in 1996. Members of the canine family are highly territorial, and wolves hunt and kill their canine competitors.\r\n\nAt the 3-mile mark, the trail passes the first of 2 campsites on Coyote Creek (the 2nd one is passed at 3.8 miles). The trail continues to parallel the creek as it climbs. At 5 miles it levels a bit, and by 6 miles it leaves the park and reaches a junction with the Trapper Trail. From there Coyote Creek Trail continues through Custer Gallatin National Forest to its end at the junction with the Telephone Basin Trail.\r\n\nThis trail is often used as part of two extended backpacking loops, both starting from the Hellroaring Creek Trailhead. Loop #1 is accomplished by hiking the first 6 miles of Coyote Creek Trail to a junction with the Old Trapper Trail, which lies just beyond Yellowstone\u2019s northern border, then taking the Trapper Trail 4.2 miles up to the top of Buffalo Plateau. There you\u2019ll make another right on the Buffalo Plateau Trail and follow it 6.8 miles back to the Coyote Creek Trail and the junction with Hellroaring Creek Trail. A great 20-mile loop from the Hellroaring Creek Trailhead.\r\n\nLoop #2 is accomplished by hiking the full 8.7-mile length of Coyote Creek Trail, then following the Telephone Basin Trail west, and the Hellroaring Creek Trail south back to the Hellroaring Creek Trailhead (make sure you take the Hellroaring Stock Cutoff Trail and use the stock bridge to avoid the dangerous ford on Hellroaring Creek).

The trail parallels the Stagecoach Road Trail for 1.2 miles heading over a small hill before rejoining it at Yancey\u2019s Hole. Many hikers prefer following the easier stage road across the open meadows.\r\n\nRegardless of the route, you soon reach Yancey\u2019s (site of nightly stagecoach cookouts). Here in 1884 John Yancey built his Pleasant Valley Hotel, a small establishment with Pullman-style beds. Patrons had to bribe the maid for clean sheets. But \"Uncle John\" made everyone feel at home. There was always some activity at the adjoining saloon. John served \"Kentucky tea\" from two shot glasses he boasted had never been tainted by a drop of water. But bigger, finer hotels were already in service by 1906 when Yancey\u2019s burned to the ground. Soon automobiles were allowed in the park and the stagecoach era ended. \r\n\nFrom Yancey's, our trail follows a singletrack north through a gap in the hills, crossing Elk Creek at the 1.7-mile mark and again at 2 miles. The trail continues along Elk Creek as it drops into an ever-narrowing canyon. The impressive rock face of Garnet Hill lies ahead. Watch for elk along this well-named creek. Garnet Hill was also appropriately named. Its dark rock is 4.5 billion-year-old granitic gneiss, which contains small imperfect red garnets.\r\n\nAt 3.5 miles the trail reaches its lowest point and passes a junction with the Garnet Hill Spur Trail (on left). Hikers often take a 1/2-mile side trip to the Yellowstone River, following this spur trail and making a right at its junction with the Hellroaring Creek Trail. At the river an impressive suspension bridge hangs above the mighty Yellowstone as it rushes furiously through a rock gorge. The scenery as you continue on the Garnet Hill Loop Trail is also outstanding as it rolls up and down around the north end of Garnet Hill and affords impressive views of the river.\r\n\nAt 5.1 miles, the trail climbs steeply 400 feet up a shoulder of Garnet Hill and away from the river.

It passes Garnet Hill Spur Trail (on right) at .8 miles and soon arrives at a dramatic crossing of the Yellowstone River. Here an impressive steel suspension bridge constructed in 1935 hangs above a small rock gorge. Far below the mighty Yellowstone rushes furiously by.\r\n\nThe trail continues through a stand of large Douglas-firs. The name is hyphenated because it is not a true fir. Its generic name is pseudotsuga, meaning \"false hemlock.\" In Yellowstone they are found only in a narrow elevation band between 6,000 and 7,000 feet. Its most distinctive feature is its female cone, which contains three-pronged, feather-like bracets between its scales. Look around for examples of these unusual seed cones. \r\n\nThe trail leaves the forest, passes a junction with the Buffalo Plateau Trail (at 1.5 miles), and continues across a sagebrush flat. The prominent conical peak that lies ahead is Hellroaring Mountain (8,363'). It's the largest outcropping of granite in Yellowstone. Most of the park's granite has been buried beneath later volcanic debris. Granite is a form of hard volcanic rock that cooled very slowly underground, allowing crystals to form. \r\n\nAt 2 miles a junction with the Hellroaring Stock Cutoff Trail is reached. The Hellroaring Creek Trail continues straight, fords the creek, turns right, and continues north along the creek. To avoid this swift, dangerous ford, most hikers follow the cutoff trail 2 miles north and cross on a stock bridge. Both trails afford great views of Hellroaring Creek, named in 1867 by gold prospectors who it was a real \"hell roarer,\" and the name stuck. \r\n\nJust past the bridge, you rejoin the main trail (at 4 miles) as it continues north. For the next 4.5 miles the trail closely follows Hellroaring Creek as it churns south, earning its name. At 7.5 miles the trail leaves Yellowstone, enters the NFS Absaroka Beartooth Wilderness, and continues another 10 miles along the creek.

Watch for buffalo in the meadows. At 0.9 miles, the trail drops slightly and crosses tiny Rescue Creek. The creek was named as a result of an incident on the 1870 Washburn Expedition. Truman Everts, an elderly member of the expedition, became separated from the group south of Yellowstone Lake. He lost his glasses, lost his horse, and spent the next 37 days starving and freezing and hallucinating as he made his way through the untracked wilderness. \r\n\nUpon his rescue, he was within but a few hours of death. Everts was found near the \"Cut\" on the Blacktail Plateau Drive, about 10 miles southeast of here. Later map makers mistakenly believed he was found on this creek and named it \u201cRescue\u201d Creek. The trail continues along Rescue Creek, following it upstream for the next mile. At 2 miles backcountry campsite 1A2 is passed and the trail veers right and leaves the creek. \r\n\nAt the 2.7-mile mark, the trail crosses an imaginary line that marks the boundary between Wyoming and Montana. At the 3.2-mile mark, you reach the highpoint of the trail and it begins a 4.4-mile, 1500-foot drop. This highpoint also marks the 45th parallel of latitude, an imaginary line that circles the globe halfway between the Equator and the North Pole. This line passes through Minneapolis-St. Paul, Ottawa, Venice, and the northern tip of Japan. Contrary to popular belief, the majority of the Montana/Wyoming state line does not follow the 45th parallel through the park. \r\n\nThe trail begins losing elevation and soon picks up Turkey Pen Creek and follows it beneath two prominent hills \u2013 first Turkey Pen Peek, then Rattlesnake Butte. A shabby, rough-hewn cabin that looked \u201clike a turkey pen\u201d was built here in 1867 by the first white settler in what later became Yellowstone National Park. Truman Everts was brought to the cabin following his rescue.\r\n\nAt 6 miles the trail levels, leaves the creek, and begins a big bend to the left across open sagebrush meadows.

Dedicated in 1923, the 157-mile HET was constructed to accommodate saddle-horse parties touring the park after automobiles pushed them off the highway. The NPS built the HET quickly by \"joining abandoned old roads, connecting existing game trails and making a trail route through open meadows with guide posts and signs.\" The trail was named in honor of Howard Eaton, the \"Dean\" of Yellowstone saddle-horse guides. \r\n\nThe trailhead begins near the Tower Fall Campground office at the rear of the campground. The trail follows Tower Creek .2 miles downstream to a bridged crossing. From there, it climbs steeply up 300 feet in the next 1/2 mile. Just above the switchbacks the trail affords impressive views of The Narrows area of the Yellowstone River, where the river flows through a tight canyon. Far below you, Tower Fall drops 132 feet on its way to join the Yellowstone. The portion of the river that you can see is relatively shallow and was used by Native Americans and early explorers as a fording spot. The historic Bannock Trail crossed the river here. From 1840 to 1878 this 200-mile trail was used by Bannock, Shoshone and Nez Perce Indians to traverse Yellowstone and reach rich buffalo hunting grounds to the east.

Enjoy occasional views to the southwest of Little America Meadows, through which lower Slough Creek flows to join the Lamar River. The trail tops the hill, drops 170 feet, and enters the \"First Meadow\" at the 2-mile mark. Here the spectacular beauty of Slough Creek's broad, open meadows unfolds before you. Nearby the Buffalo Fork Trail splits to the left and makes a difficult ford of Slough Creek and an NPS patrol cabin is passed on the right. \r\n\nThe creek was named in 1867 by gold prospectors who said it \"Twas but a slough,\" and the name stuck. Slough Creek is the holy grail for many fly fishermen, in fact some guides proclaim it to be the finest cutthroat trout stream in America, if not the world!\r\n\nThe trail briefly rises away from the creek then rejoins it at 3.7 miles. It then skirts the edge of the valley, rising gently for the next 13 miles, before beginning a long 1500 foot climb to the creek's headwaters. Nearby Slough Creek rolls tirelessly along on it's meandering path. At 5.8 miles notice how the creek has over time changed its course and left scars on the land, even a small oxbow lake. In July, wildflowers mantle the valley. Wild onion is one of the most prevalent. Its slender stem is topped by a clump of small reddish-purple flowers. The familiar smell is a giveaway.  \r\n\nAt 7.1 miles the trail passes the Elk Tongue Patrol Cabin (here the Bliss Pass Trail splits to the right). Our trail continues north, closely following the creek for miles. To the northeast Cutoff Mountain dominates the skyline. At 10.6 miles the trail leaves Yellowstone and passes the posh Silver Tip Ranch, a century-old guest ranch.  \r\n\nAt 13 miles the trail passes a NFS patrol cabin and at 14.4 miles fords Slough Creek. Thereafter it enters Frenchy Meadows, named for Frenchy Duret, a poacher who settled here in the 1890s. He was killed in 1922 by a grizzly he trapped. His bloody death was splashed across newspapers nationwide. His grave is at the foot of the hill to the left of the meadow.  \r\n\nThe trail beyond the meadows is seldom traveled.

The erosive powers of Tower Creek and the Yellowstone River have cut deep into the landscape. Tower Fall exists because Tower Creek could not carve as deep or as fast as the more powerful Yellowstone River. The rocks at the brink of the falls, and the vertical cliff beneath, are coarse breccias and conglomerates of the Eocene Epoch. The pinnacles that tower above the fall are capped with large boulders that prevented their erosion. \r\n\nThe 1870 Washburn Expedition named it \"Tower\" Fall for its prominent pinnacles. In Washburn's words it looked \"like some old castle with its turrets dismantled but still standing.\" For more than 100 years, one of Tower Fall's most prominent features was a large boulder that appeared to be precariously perched on its brink. Early explorers cast bets on the hour it would fall. They would have been shocked to know it did not come tumbling down until June 1986. A sign asking \"When will the boulder fall?\" was still up years later, prompting sarcastic park employees to ask, \"When will the sign come down?\"\r\n\nTo the right of the overlook, the well-maintained trail switchbacks down to the Yellowstone River.

They entered the present park occasionally to hunt big game or gather obsidian for fashioning weapons. Most of the tribes viewed Yellowstone and its remarkable geothermal features as a place of spiritual power and did not fear it as some early historians asserted.\r\n\nThis relatively shallow section of the Yellowstone River was used by Native Americans and early explorers as a fording spot.

The trail climbs 100 feet in the first .1 miles, but after that, it's never too steep. There you reach the edge of the canyon overlooking the Yellowstone River. The trail then rambles along the rim for almost 2 miles. The views are spectacular, but dangerous. BEWARE of serious exposed cliffs - watch your kids closely - it's easy to get caught-up in the view and not look where you are putting your feet!\r\n\nThis is a wild section of the river that twists and turns through the canyon and splashes white over the rocks far below. One of America's few northward flowing rivers, the Yellowstone begins south of the park and travels 670 miles before emptying into the Missouri River near the Montana-North Dakota border. It is the longest undammed river in the continental United States. \r\n\nThe trail takes a couple of dips and at the .9-mile mark begins a gradual 200-foot climb over the next .8 miles. Soon the canyon gets deeper and narrower - in fact this section is called \"The Narrows.\" The opposite side of the canyon seems close enough to touch. At 1.1 miles, you'll notice (and perhaps smell) some hot spring activity across the river. These are the Calcite Springs. \r\n\nAs the trail keeps climbing watch the rock cliffs below, you may see some of the bighorn sheep that summer in the area. Although related to domestic sheep, the bighorn has a coat of hair, not wool.  Both the male (ram) and female (ewe) have horns that are never shed. Only the ram will develop the full 360-degree curl. \r\n\nAt the 1.5-mile mark notice the unusual rock formation just above the highway on the opposite side of the river. It looks like a row of fence posts! This geological formation is called \"columnar basalt.\" Cooling of an ancient lava flow caused the rock to contract and crack into many-sided columns.  At 1.7 miles the trail turns left and continues to a junction with the Specimen Ridge Trail. You can follow it to the left 1.1 miles to the trailhead then hike the road back to the picnic area, but I recommend returning the way you came - the views are much better!\r\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

Going down the other side you cross Little Cottonwood Creek and get your first glimpses of the Yellowstone. The trail continues dropping - by 3.3 miles views of the river are excellent and by 4 miles you\u2019re at river level. The wild Yellowstone River begins south of the park and travels 670 miles before joining the Missouri River near the MT-ND border. It's the longest un-dammed river in the lower 48.\r\n\nThe trail continues alongside the Yellowstone, passes a junction with Blacktail Deer Creek Trail at 7.1 miles, passes Crevice Lake at 7.3, crosses Crevice Creek at 8.3, and reaches impressive Knowles Falls at 9 miles. Though only 15 feet high, the falls makes quite a roar and the scenery is excellent. In the 1870s & 80s John Knowles lived and prospected illegally in the park. When his cabin near the mouth of Crevice Creek was finally discovered, the government ran him out.  \r\n\nFrom the falls, the trail continues closely along the river. At 10.2 miles, the water turns white and the most dramatic portion of the hike is reached as the trail winds through a massive rock slide with excellent views at every turn. Members of the Washburn Expedition of 1870 described the Black Canyon as \"grand, gloomy, and terrible . . . an empire of shadows and of turmoil.\" \r\n\nAt 13.6 miles the trail crosses Bear Creek on a footbridge. Thereafter, you'll notice the remains of hot spring activity in the area. Limestone deposits like these have been commercially mined north of Gardiner. At 13.8 miles a junction is reached. The former Yellowstone River Trail continued straight following the river all the way into Gardiner, MT. However, private land owners in Gardiner, just north of the park are blocking hiker access to the trail. As a temporary (hopefully) fix it is possible to turn right and follow a Gallatin National Forest trail up 750 feet over the next 2 miles to Eagle Creek Campground. The good news is the trail is in great shape and it affords nice views back into the Black Canyon and of hard-charging Bear Creek. There\u2019s even some interesting abandoned mining equipment to investigate along the creek.\r\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

Here the mighty river thunderously plunges 308 feet into the heart of the canyon and hikers are afforded spectacular views down river into the vast, colorful canyon.\r\n\nFrom the Brink of Lower Falls parking area, the trail (which technically doesnt begin until the end of the first switchback) drops more than 300 feet in 0.4 miles. This very popular trail is often quite crowded. It is even more crowed since the direction of the one-way North Rim Road was changed making this the first stop on the road. Now, many visitors stop here thinking its a short way to the viewpoint and are unprepared for this steep, somewhat difficult trail. So expect a slow hike down and an even slower hike back up. But the views at the bottom are amazing, making it a must-do hike for many.\r\n\nIn 1887, Owen Wister, gathering stories and inspiration later used in his classic western novel, The Virginian, described Lower Falls this way:  \"This is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen. The water falls . . . 300 feet into a caldron of rock . . . the spray floats out into a rainbow that melts away into many-coloured moss, until you cannot discern which is moss and which rainbow.\"\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

In the summer months this is an auto road. This 1.7-mile, occasionally groomed, ski trail takes cross-country skiers and snowshoers to Inspiration Point for commanding views of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone and a portion of Lower Falls.\r\n\nThe trailhead begins on the North Rim Road near the Canyon Village Visitor's Center. It follows the road 0.8 miles then turns left and follows the spur road 0.9 miles to Inspiration Point. At the 1.3 mile mark, the trail passes Glacial Boulder, a 500-ton granite \"calling card\" left behind 10,000 years ago as the Pinedale Glaciation retreated north.\r\n\nThe existence of this \"glacial erratic\" so near the river-eroded canyon and so far from any significant granite formation, posed a profound riddle for early geologists. In 1878 a young geologist, named William H. Holmes, found cover from a thunder storm beside this rock. He wrote, \"[I] took shelter under the overhanging edge of a great rock in the dense timber. Considerably to my surprise I found it to be a very compact, coarsely crystalline feldspathic granite . . . It is within a stone's throw of the brink of the Canyon and rests upon a sheet or series of rhyolite, not less than one thousand feet in thickness.\" This set him to thinking. Then, like a bolt of lightning, it came to him that this rock was likely quarried high in the Beartooth Mountains to the northeast and transported more than 30 miles downstream by a massive river of ice. Years later, geologists reasoned that glaciers moved across, rather than through the canyon, and had little to do with its carving.    \r\n\nThe trail ends at the 1.7 mile mark as it drops to Inspiration Point parking area. Head out to Inspiration Point to take a look. Until 1975 the walkway led all the way to the point. A significant earthquake that summer caused rock to weaken and eventually a 300-foot vertical column of rock slid out from under the walkway. There were 15 visitors on the scenic overlook when the slide occurred. Fourteen scrambled to safety, while the 15th remained to take pictures. When he was rescued, he had some pretty good shots!\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

Automobiles arrived in Yellowstone in 1916 and it was quickly apparent horses and cars did not mix. To accommodate saddle-horse parties, a 157-mile trail following the main highway was cobbled together \u201cjoining abandoned old roads, connecting existing game trails and making a trail route through open meadows with guide posts and signs.\u201d The trail, dedicated in 1923, was named in honor of Howard Eaton, the \u201cDean\u201d of Yellowstone saddle-horse guides.\r\n\nFrom the trailhead, the HET skirts the western shore of Cascade Lake then gently climbs 100 feet in the first 1.1 miles. As you near the highpoint, the trail bends right around the southern terminus of the Washburn Range and crosses an almost unnoticeable hydraulic divide. Behind you, the water drains into Cascade Creek and the Yellowstone River. Ahead, the water drains into the Gibbon River and on to the Madison and Missouri rivers. The waters meet-up again at the confluence of the Yellowstone and Missouri rivers near the Montana, North Dakota border. \r\n\nAt the 2-mile mark, the trail reaches 156-acre Grebe Lake and a junction with the Grebe Lake Trail. The HET continues around the northern side of the lake passing a number of nice campsites before reaching the lake\u2019s outlet at 2.8 miles. Fishing is excellent here for rainbow trout and rare Arctic Grayling.\r\n\nGrebe Lake is the headwater of the Gibbon River and the HET follows the Gibbon for the next 2 miles. At 3.9 miles the HET makes its first of 4 Gibbon crossings. Here the Gibbon flows into and then out of 50-acre Wolf Lake (good fishing and campsites). The trail passes south of Wolf Lake and again fords at 4.2 miles. Then the HET rolls up and down through the trees and twice fords the Gibbon (at 4.7 and 6.9 miles), passes the Wolf Lake Trail at 6.4 miles, and reaches Ice Lake at 7.2 miles.  \r\n\nThe HET continues along the north side of heavily-treed, 53-acre Ice Lake (poor fishing) before passing the Ice Lake Trail at 7.9 miles. In the last 4.4 miles, the trail drops 450 feet, along the way crossing Norris Meadow (at 9.9 miles) and fording Solfatara Creek just before ending at a junction with the Solfatara Creek Trail, a 1/2 mile from Norris Campground.\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

It is much easer to take this trail in this direction, since it drops (steeply in some points) almost 2,400 feet from the top of the mountain to nearly the rim of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. The most frequent use of this trail is a one-way outing from Dunraven Pass, over Mt. Washburn, down the back side of Washburn, and continuing on to Canyon Village.\r\n\nBut this trail is much more than a mere connector. It travels east from the Washburn Fire Lookout along a singletrack trail through open meadows of beautiful wildflowers - low mats of 5-petalled white to lavender flowers known as phlox, striking rocket-shaped pink and yellow flowers called shooting star, and the long spines of deep purple pealike flowers named lupine. \r\n\nSoon the trail enters the forest and begins its sharp descent. Look for the distinctive five-needle clusters on the whitebark pines. The bark of its seedlings is covered with a fine white coating and mature trees often display a whitish cast. Here, at higher elevations, near timberline, the whitebark pines become dwarfed and gnarled by harsh weather conditions. \r\n\nThis trail was built in August of 1917, the summer after automobiles were first allowed into Yellowstone. It likely was used as means for horse traffic to reach Canyon Village without mixing with cars on the Chittenden Road over Mount Washburn.\r\n\nThe trail continues its steep descent through an occasional meadow and nice views to the south of the rim of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone an Hayden Valley beyond. Hang on -- between the 1.5 and 2.5 mile marks the trail drops more than 1,250 feet. Once down, the trail passes through a beautiful meadow with nice views back to Mt Washburn. \r\n\nAt the 4 mile mark, the trail passes the Washburn Hot Springs, a collection of highly acidic mud pots, easily found on the right (NW) side of the trail. Members of the 1870 Washburn Expedition called this area \"Hell-Broth Springs,\" because it was such an \"infernal looking smelling and sounding place.\" Continuing the satanic nomenclature, individual thermal features in the area were later dubbed the \"Devil's Cauldron\" and the \"Devil's Ink Pot.\" \r\n\nThe Mount Washburn Spur Trail ends at the junction with the Seven Mile Hole Trail.\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

Sections are easily accessible from the road so you'll see people nearby. But, as others scurry from their cars to the edge for a quick look hikers can truly experience it.\r\n\nBefore starting, visit Inspiration Point to view the canyon and a portion of Lower Falls. Until 1975 the walkway led all the way to the point. A significant earthquake that summer caused rock to weaken and eventually a 300-foot vertical column of rock slid out from under the walkway. There were 15 visitors on the scenic overlook when the slide occurred. Fourteen scrambled to safety, while the 15th remained to take pictures. When he was rescued, he had some pretty good shots!\r\n\nThe North Rim Trail begins to the right of Inspiration Point and meanders up and down along the canyon rim 1 mile to Grandview. This is one of my favorite sections of the trail; there is no road in sight and relatively few people use this section. Hikers enjoy impressive intermittent views of canyon color through the lodgepole pine and occasional subalpine fir trees. \r\n\nViews become more impressive as you approach Grandview. From here the trail, rejoined by the road, continues upriver along the very edge of this awe-inspiring canyon. At the 1.3 mile mark you reach Lookout Point. A short walkway leads to the point where you get your first great vantage of Lower Falls. Its 308-foot plunge is approximately twice that of Niagara Falls. From here you can take a side trip to Red Rock Point. This well-groomed, but steep, spur trail drops 500 feet in 0.3 miles to one of the area's finest views of Lower Falls.\r\n\nAs you continue from Lookout Point you eventually spy, in the distance, the spray from 109-foot Upper Falls. Here, at the 2.2 mile mark, you are directly above the Lower Falls. A paved spur trail switchbacks down 600 feet in 0.5 miles to the brink of Lower Falls.\r\n\nTo continue the North Rim Trail, start down the spur trail to Lower Falls, but proceed straight into the forest at the first switchback. Soon the trail crosses Cascade Creek just above Crystal Falls. For a good view of this delicate falls, take a short spur trail to the left about 100 yards past the creek. At 2.7 miles, cross the Brink of Upper Falls parking area and follow an easy stone stairway to the brink of the falls. \r\n\nThe North Rim Trail continues upstream hugging the relatively calm Yellowstone River.

As you climb, views of 36-acre Cascade Lake behind you soon fade. At 1.9 miles, the trail bends left as it tops the ridge. Soon you get nice views of much larger, 156-acre Grebe Lake, the headwaters of the Gibbon River.\r\n\nThe summit of Observation Peak and the end of the trail is reached at 2.6 miles. The views here are outstanding. The peak lies in the heart of the Washburn Range, drained to the north by Tower Creek. The western horizon is dominated by the Gallatin Range. To the south lies Hayden Valley. \r\n\nIt was this great view, especially down the Tower Creek drainage, that caused the NPS to construct this fire lookout in 1939 (with help from the C.C.C.). Wildfire was a significant motivator for building trails and lookouts in Yellowstone. In 1910, huge fires burned more than 5 million acres across the west, killing 85 people, mostly in western Montana and Idaho. Thereafter, the Park Service and Forest Service began building \u201cfire lanes,\u201d many of which are hiking trails today.  \r\n\nYellowstone constructed 3 primary fire lookouts on Mount Washburn (in 1921), Mount Sheridan (1926), and Mount Holmes (1931). The fire lookout station here was a \"secondary lookout\" built to see a \"blind areas\" not seen from the primary lookouts. Other secondary looks include Bunsen Peak, Pelican Cone, and Purple Mountain (structure no longer present).

It descends gradually at first, then more steeply as it enters a series of stairs. Near the bottom, notice how Red Rock Point is connected to the canyon wall by an earthen hinge. Geologists have determined that the small depression between Red Rock Point and the north canyon wall was once occupied by an ancestral channel of the Yellowstone River. During the Pleistocene epoch, glaciers flowed across the top of the canyon, dropping ice into the canyon and  damming the river's course. As the ice melted, the resurrected river followed a new course on the opposite side of Red Rock Point and continued cutting another 400 feet deep into the canyon floor. \r\n\nThe red color of Red Rock Point is a result of thermally-altered rhyolite and exposed iron oxides.

For the first 1.5 miles, the trail remains very close to the rim of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone with frequent overlooks. Several of the overlooks offer impressive views of Silver Cord Cascade tumbling into the canyon. From mile 1.5 until 3.3, the trail remains very pleasant and mostly flat but the views disappear due to the forested environment.  At mile 2.8, bear right to continue towards Seven Mile Hole (left goes to Mt. Washburn).  \r\n\nAt mile 3.3, the trail begins the descent to the bottom of the canyon. At times, the trail is very steep and loose scree makes for poor traction. At mile 3.8, the trail passes by an igloo-shaped cone for an extinct hot spring. At mile 4.1, the trail enters an active thermal area with expansive views. The hot spring straight ahead (towards the canyon) as the trail enters the thermal area is the most impressive. You can hear it roaring from a distance and it puts off a lot of steam. Leaving the thermal area, the descent gets less steep and approaches the canyon walls again.

It follows the mighty Yellowstone River 1.8 miles downstream, past impressive views of both Upper Falls and Lower Falls of the Yellowstone, and ends near spectacular Artist Point. (HikerS beginning their trip here should park at the Wapiti Lake Picnic Area and Trailhead 100 yards beyond the bridge on the right). \r\n\nHiking is pleasant along the first stretch of trail through lodgepole pine and, occasional, five-needled limber pine. There are intermittent views of the river as it churns away toward its violent destiny. Soon the trail opens up and provides good views of Upper Falls. About 0.6 miles from Chittenden Bridge, the Upper Falls Viewpoint is reached. Although you are likely to experience crowds here, it is still the best place to view the Upper Falls. The falls spills 109 feet over a dense rhyolite lava flow that is resistant to erosion. Immediately downstream, a much softer rhyolite, containing larger amounts of volcanic glass, was more easily eroded by the river.  \r\n\nAs you continue along the South Rim Trail, look carefully through the trees to the opposite side of the canyon. Cascading through the lodgepoles, down the far wall, is the lovely 129-foot Crystal Falls. \r\n\nAbout 0.9 miles from Chittenden Bridge, you reach the turnoff for Uncle Tom's Trail to the bottom of the canyon. This trail uses a series of steel stairways to descend more than 300 feet in 0.3 miles.\r\n\nAlthough heavily traveled, the next section of the South Rim Trail, between Uncle Tom's Trail and Artist Point, is truly spectacular! Picturesque views of the canyon and Lower Falls await you each time you break out of the trees. As you continue to Artist Point, take a moment to contemplate how this magnificent canyon and falls were created. Hundreds of thousands of years before the canyon was formed, an ancient thermal basin existed. The hot waters altered and weakened the hard rhyolite lava in the area, allowing the river to cut this deep canyon. Today, Lower Falls tumbles 308 feet over a hard, thermally-unaltered rhyolite flow.\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

Autos arrived in Yellowstone in 1916, and it was quickly apparent horses and cars did not mix. To accommodate saddle-horses, a 157-mile trail following the main highway was cobbled together in 1923 and named for the \"Dean\" of Yellowstone saddle-horse guides. \r\n\nThe trail begins just east of the Fishing Bridge and travels along the river, passing the remains of lodging accommodations. At one time, Fishing Bridge had cabins and a NPS campground (in addition to the current facilities). To protect archeological sites and grizzly-bear habitat and as part of an agreement to build Grant Village, the cabins and NPS campground were removed. \r\n\nThe trail follows the river and a service road for 0.8 miles, then veers off the road to the left and follows the Yellowstone. Watch for waterfowl for the next mile or so, including white pelican and trumpeter swan. You may also see an osprey or bald eagle circling above looking for a fat cutthroat trout. Fishermen use this trail to reach them as well.\r\n\nAt 2.2 miles, the trail leaves the river and climbs the first of numerous hills you'll face. At 3.9 miles, the trail breaks out for a nice overview of LeHardy\u2019s Rapids. This lovely rapids was named for a member of the 1873 Jones Expedition whose raft was lost in the rapids. From here on, the highway is rarely out of sight or hearing distance. Many use the overlook as a turn-around point.\r\n\nThe trail continues up and down through the forest, breaking out at the 6-mile mark and passing Nez Perce Ford (a shallow place in the river historically used by native Americans to cross) and the Mud Volcano Area (across the river). At 6.8 miles, the trail enters Hayden Valley, Yellowstone's largest (23,000 acres). \r\n\nAbout 14,000 years ago, glacial ice blocked the Yellowstone's northern flow, causing water to back up and cover the valley. Fine sand, silt and clay accumulated at the bottom of the lake. The glaciers receded and the lake drained, leaving the poor soil that is the reason Hayden Valley exists.\r\n\nThe trail may be hard to find in the open meadows. Just continue north along the edge of the valley near the treeline and you'll eventually be back on trail. At 11.6 miles, turn left at the junction with Sour Creek Trail and ford Sour Creek (which is usually knee-deep by mid July). The trail continues another 2.7 miles and ends near the Chittenden Bridge.\r\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

The lower loop to Dragon's Mouth and the Mud Volcano is wheelchair accessible. The features in the Mud Volcano Area are among the park\u2019s most acidic. Hydrogen sulfide gas, with its odor of rotten eggs, makes this one of the smelliest places in Yellowstone. \r\n\nBegin your adventure at the far right end of the parking area. Follow the boardwalk to turbulent, splashing Dragon's Mouth Spring. The rhythmic belching of steam and the flashing tongue of water give the Dragon's Mouth its name. Although there is much activity here, notice that very little water leaves the pool through its runoff outlet. \r\n\nNext up is the Mud Volcano. When the 1870 Washburn Expedition described Mud Volcano as \"greatest marvel we have yet met with.\" At that time, Mud Volcano had a cone-shaped mud deposit (like a volcano) that covered the feature and give off booming sounds that could be heard a mile away \u201clike the discharge of artillery.\u201d They further reported that it threw mud immense distances and that they found it in the tops of trees 100 feet high and 200 feet away. By 1872 a thermal explosion had blown the mud cone away to reveal what we see today. Although the Mud Volcano can no longer be heard from a mile away nor does it throw mud hundreds of feet in the air, the area is still intriguing.\r\n\nFrom Mud Volcano the trail begins to climb up the hill to Sour Lake and Black Dragon's Caldron. Along the way you\u2019ll pass Grizzly Fumarole. The hiss and roar of a fumarole comes from gases - steam, carbon dioxide, and a little hydrogen sulfide - rushing from the earth through the vent.\r\n\nSour Lake is just that, a thermally-fed small lake. Just beyond it is Black Dragon's Caldron. It exploded onto the landscape in 1948, blowing trees out by their roots and covering the surrounding forest with mud. The large turbulent stirring at one end of the Caldron gives one the sense that the Black Dragon itself might rear its head at any time.\r\n\nThe trail then loops back down the hill, along the way passing Churning Caldron and Sizzling Spring. The slope below Sizzling Basin, once covered with green grass and trees, became a barren landscape of fallen trees now known as \"the cooking hillside.\" Near the bottom of the hill you\u2019ll see the area known as Mud Geyser, a large muddy pool to the right, that for 30 years in the 1800s erupted to heights of 20 to 50 feet.\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

The climb from here is steady. Be mindful of fallen logs across the trail. The first mile will rise almost 500 feet, giving you glimpses of the valley below behind you. The trail maintains a steady but gradual climb from here. The trail will weave between new growth and old growth forests, providing opportunities for shade at certain points along the way. \r\n\nThe trail increases steepness at 2.5 miles in. Just past 3 miles, you'll enter into a fresh burn. You'll lose shade at this point so be prepared. The trail becomes less obvious and maintained-watch your footing.

Before ascending the final climb, you'll be able to see the Beartooths and a fantastic view to the north. At the top, you'll see the fire lookout and incredible 360-degree views of the mountains around. On a clear day, you can see the Tetons in the distance. \r\n\nWatch for afternoon thunderstorms that can change direction quickly. Mountain peaks are not a safe place to be during a thunderstorm. \r\n\nThis trail is fantastic for wildflowers throughout July and early August. It provides great opportunities to see bison, elk, deer, grizzly bear and black bear. Keep your eyes peeled for signs of animals including tracks, scat, and rubbed/scratched trees.\r\n\nThis is a long hike and the hours to be in Pelican Valley are 9am-7pm. This will be difficult to complete in one day without a fast pace and prepared group. There are not campsites in Pelican Valley so this must be done as a day hike.

The NPS regularly gives interpretive walks on this short loop trail. Inquire at the Fishing Bridge Visitor Center for a schedule of walks. But you\u2019ll can enjoy this trail anytime.   \r\n\nFrom the parking area follow the trail toward Yellowstone Lake. To your left is Pelican Creek and an estuary-like marsh where the creak joins the lake. This is a good area to spot a variety of waterfowl, including mallard, lesser scamp, Canada geese, Barrow's goldeneye, and common merganser. You may see a the creek\u2019s namesake, the white pelican. Unlike the brown pelican, which dives for fish, the white pelican scoops up its prey in its oversized yellow bill, while cruising across the water's surface. In this vicinity in 1864, prospector John Davis shot and killed what he thought was a goose (actually a pelican). Upon retrieving his prey he found it too strange to eat and instead left it hanging in a tree. Most likely this incident led to the naming of Pelican Creek.\r\n\nAt the .3-mile mark, the lake shore is reached. Yellowstone Lake is an amazingly beautiful high altitude lake. Early trappers and explorers were amazed that a lake of such huge dimensions (135 square miles of surface area) could lie at such a high elevation above sea level (7,733 feet). Today we know that Yellowstone Lake is the largest lake for its elevation above sea level anywhere in North America.\r\n\nDuring the afternoons, and particularly during storms, the prevailing southwest wind blows across the lake and builds large waves that roll onto the shore. The beautiful sandy beach that lies along this northern shore of Yellowstone Lake was named \"Diamond Beach\" for its sparkling, flashing tiny particles of sand. Marveling at the lake's power and beauty, the 1869 Cook-Folsom-Peterson party saw the lake as having \"crystal waves dancing and sparkling in the sunlight as if laughing for joy for their wild freedom.\"\r\n\nThe island not far from shore is Stevenson Island. James Stevenson, a prominent member of the 1871 Hayden Survey, assembled a 12-foot sailboat that he used to reach the island later named in his honor. His craft, which he christened the \"Anna\" after the daughter of an influential Congressman, was the first known vessel to ply the lake's waters.  \r\n\nThe trail continues along the lake shore a short distance before looping back to the right, entering the forest, and returning to the trailhead.\r\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

It ends south of the Thorofare Ranger Station on the park's southern boundary, the most remote spot in the Lower 48 - more than 25 miles from the nearest road. It\u2019s possible to continue south through Bridger-Teton National Forest to US Highway 287 or turn west on Yellowstone\u2019s South Boundary Trail to the South Entrance.\r\n\nThe first 1.3 miles to Cub Creek, the trail passes through forests burned in 2003. The next 1.2 mi, from Cub Creek to Clear Creek, it passes through a forest burned in 2011. It\u2019s interesting to see the difference in forest regeneration these 8 years make. Both Cub and Clear Creeks, and numerous other Yellowstone Lake tributaries crossed on this trail, are used by cutthroat trout leaving the lake to spawn upstream. These streams are closed to fishing until July 15, to allow grizzly bears first crack at the big 15-inch trout. \r\n\nAt 3.4 miles are the first decent views of Yellowstone Lake. They are short-lived, as the trail enters unburned forests at the 4-mi mark. At 6.4 mi the trail breaks out south of Park Point, crosses Meadow Creek, and closely follows the lake for almost 2 mi, affording awesome views. As you continue the most noticeable features are the Promontory, just across the Southeast Arm, and Brimstone Basin, the large white outcropping to the southeast.\r\n\nThe trail crosses Columbine Creek at 9.5 miles. The next nice views of the lake are at Terrace Point, at 15.2 mi. Here early geologists found evidence of several former beaches proving the lake was once 160 feet higher. As you approach Beaverdam Creek (at 17.6 mi) views of the Yellowstone River delta become impressive and Colter Peak dominates the skyline to the SE.\r\n\nThe trail passes Cabin Creek Patrol Cabin and Lower Ford Trail, and reaches the banks of the Yellowstone at 20.6 miles. From here the rare beauty of the Upper Yellowstone begins to unfold. The trail continues through forests burned in 1988 and crosses Trappers Creek at 23.5 mi. Above you to the to the SE is distinctive Turret Mountain. At 26.2 mi cross Mountain Creek (trails to the left lead to Eagle Pass). The next 3 mi, several scenic spur trails lead to campsites on the Yellowstone River. \r\n\nThe trail passes the three the fingers of The Trident, crosses Cliff and Escarpment creeks (between the fingers), and at 33.2 miles reaches the Thorofare Ranger Station.

The trail climbs 650 ft in the first 2 mi to the first of 2 Continental Divide crossings. The trail dips to cross a stream flowing west to the Firehole River then again crosses the Divide at 3 mi. The Firehole Rive flows to the Gulf of Mexico via the Madison, Missouri, and the Mississippi rivers. The Bechler River drainage ahead of you flows west to the Pacific Ocean via the Bechler, Falls, Snake, and Columbia rivers. \r\n\nThe trail crosses Littles Fork and enters its lovely meadow at 5 mi, continues past Douglas Knob, and crosses the Gregg Fork at 7.2 miles. Thereafter, the short Twister Falls Trail (on right) leads to an overlook of the 55 ft falls (misplaced upstream on some maps). The trail continues along the Gregg 2 more miles, passes the Farris Fork Spur Trail (on left), crosses the Farris Fork, and reaches Three Rivers Junction at 9 miles. \r\n\nThree Rivers is special! Here the Gregg, Farris, and Phillips forks join to form the Bechler River, named for Gustavus Bechler, chief topographer for the 1872 Hayden Survey. Little attention was paid to the park's southwest corner for the next 50 years. Then, in the face of attempts to dam the Bechler for irrigation, William Gregg explored the area and published articles describing its numerous waterfalls. There are 30 falls and cascades within 2 miles of Three Rivers, including 45-ft Ragged Falls, just up stream on the Farris Fork. \r\n\nFor 6.7 miles the trail follows the river through Bechler Canyon, passing Three Rivers Cabin Trail (at 9.7 mi), Treasure Island (at 13.5), 45-ft Iris Falls (at 13.6), stunning, two-tiered Colonnade Falls (35 ft & 67 ft; at 14 mi), before entering Bechler Meadows. Along the way youll cross numerous streams and twice ford the Bechler. By early August the Upper Ford (at 11 mi) is usually knee-deep but the Lower Ford (at 12.6 mi) may be hip-deep (look for a shallow course on the downstream side).\r\n\nThe trail passes Bechler Meadows Cutoff Trail (at 17.2 mi) and skirts the east side of this beautiful meadow, passes Mountain Ash Creek Trail (at 20.4), and makes its final knee-to-hip-deep ford of the Bechler at Rocky Ford (at 21.4). It then follows the Bechler (past Bechler Cuttoff Trail at 23.4) past 15-ft Bechler Falls and the Falls River confluence (at 25.4), and reaches 250-ft wide & 20-ft high Cave Falls at 25.2 miles.

It's a shame, because there are some really interesting and beautiful features here.\r\n\nThe Black Sand Basin is found just west of the Old Faithful Interchange (in the direction of Madison Junction). The parking area is just south of the road. The basin is named for Black Sand Pool, which lies on the opposite side of the highway. Before the Interchange was built, visitors following the spur road from Giant Geyser to Black Sand Basin passed Black Sand Pool. A trail still leads to it, but it is infrequently visited. \r\n\nThe basin lies on either side of Iron Spring Creek. Early geologists mistakenly attributed the red color on the banks of the creek to the mineral iron - it's actually red because of cyanobacteria living in the hot spring water. Just across the creek from our first stop is Cliff Geyser. The geyserite buildup next to the creek is the \"cliff\" that gives the geyser its name. It has changed character over the years, but most often it erupts 10 to 15 feet high in intervals of less than 3 minutes.\r\n\nThe boardwalk passes Green Spring and crosses the creek. Turn left at the junction and follow the boardwalk out to see Emerald Pool. Its beautiful emerald tint is caused by the blue water in the deep pool combining with the yellow bacteria growing on the sides of the bowl.\r\n\nReturn to the boardwalk junction and take a left. Soon you'll pass (on the right) a big, beautiful Rainbow Pool. Its crater is nearly 100 feet across. Sunset Lake is an even larger hot spring. It was named for its intense flame-like colors. Both springs have in the past temporarily erupted as geysers. \r\n\nThe most famous feature of the basin, Handkerchief Pool, no longer exhibits its unique characteristics. From the late 1800s through the 1920s visitors were encouraged to put their handkerchief in the small pool. The water would suck it down and a few minutes later would return it to the top \"nice and clean.\" Today placing objects in any hot spring or geyser is illegal and very damaging to the delicate features. The remnants of Handkerchief Pool are located in the runoff channel of Rainbow Pool.\r\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

At the top, you\u2019ll reach a wonderful overlook of the entire Upper Geyser Basin. The 150 active geysers in the basin comprise more than 25% of the world's total and include some of the largest and most predictable geysers. Sit and wait a while and maybe you'll see one erupt. Old Faithful Geyser, surrounded by buildings, is easy to spot. Other geysers with eruptions large enough to identify from here include Castle, Grand and Riverside geysers. \r\n\nAfter enjoying the view, follow Fairy Creek Trail west as it runs up and down through burned forests along the rim of the plateau. At 1.1 miles the Mystic Falls Trail rejoins from the left. From here, the trail climbs another 400 feet to its highpoint at 2.9 miles. You'll not notice it, but the headwaters of Fairy Creek lie just to the right. The trail then drops 300 feet to the Little Firehole River at 5.1 miles. This river contains a diverse mix of brook, brown, rainbow, and cutthroat trout. The trail parallels the river for the next 1/2 mile then breaks out on the edge of beautiful Little Firehole Meadows at 5.6 miles. In this huge meadow, three creeks come together to form the Little Firehole. Be sure to make your way up the hill to the right of the trail for the best view of the meadow. \r\n\nThe trail continues along the northeast edge of the meadow for a 1/2 mile then reenters the burned forest. The next 4+ miles travels over a fairly boring section of the Madison Plateau. At the 10-mile mark it finally breaks out and affords nice views off the plateau to a pretty valley into which the trail descends. The prominent mound to the northeast is South Twin Butte. The buttes are huge mounds of gravel dropped by glaciers thousands of years ago as they passed over active hot springs. \r\n\nAt 11 miles Imperial Geyser is reached.

The 2nd half -- south from Heart Lake to the Snake River is seldom traveled. \r\n\nThe trail begins gently rising through lodgepole forests and occasional meadows. This area was partially burned in 1988. Lodgepoles have an unusual way of coping with fire. Besides their annual seed cones, they produce a special \"serotinous cone,\" which only opens at  113 F, allowing the forest to reseed following fire.\r\n\nAt the 4.5-mile mark, the trail breaks suddenly open and affords one of the most memorable vistas in all of Yellowstone. Hydrothermal activity is evident beneath you. As you peer down Witch Creek drainage, Heart Lake appears deceivingly close. In the next mile, the trail descends 500 feet through forests heavily burned by the 1988 fires.  \r\n\nAt the 8-mile mark, the trail passes Heart Lake Ranger Station and reaches a junction with the Trail Creek Trail on the shores of Heart Lake. The Heart Lake Trail continues right (south) and follows the western shore. There are excellent campsites in the area.\r\n\nHeart Lake covers 2150 acres and has a depth of 180 feet. It has a healthy population of native cutthroat trout and large lake trout. Less than 0.5 miles past the trail junction a large thermal area is spotted across a small meadow. To avoid marshy areas continue south on the trail until you pass the springs and reach the trees. Then follow the tree line out. \r\n\nThere are several geysers and a beautiful spring (Columbia Spring) in this group. Rustic Geyser, dormant since 1984, is the largest (25-to-30-foot) and most famous in Heart Lake Geyser Basin. Since 1984, the new star of the basin is Composite Geyser. Its 20-foot eruptions occur at intervals of 1  to 3 hours. Kickback and wait awhile. It's quite a thrill to have a geyser play just for you! A short distance beyond the geyser basin, the trail passes the Mount Sheridan Trail, then parallels the lake's western shore for several miles. \r\n\nThe 2nd half of the trail leaves Heart Lake, travels up and down, gradually descending 500 feet to the Snake River, passing Sheridan Lake at 11.5 mi., a junction with Basin Creek Cutoff Trail at 13 mi., and Basin Creek Lake at 14.5 mi.

Since Shoshone is only 11 feet higher than Lewis Lake, the river forms a channel that kayakers and canoeists use to paddle to Shoshone Lake. It is the only river in Yellowstone where boating is allowed. Chances are you'll see canoers on this trip. Watch closely, you may also see osprey, bald eagles, and other water foul that frequent these waters.\n\nThe trail above the channel is quite scenic affording nice views of the river and the surrounding area. Youll also notice the remaining effects of the 1988 fires that burned in this area, particularly when the trail wanders from the channel and gains elevation. The fire here was spotty, burning the crowns of some trees and the trunks of others, while leaving some unaffected.\n\nAt the 6.4-mile mark, Shoshone Lake is reached. At 8,050 acres, Shoshone is the second largest lake in the park and the largest backcountry lake in the lower 48. Its deep too, with a maximum depth over 200 feet. It was named for the Shoshone Indians who frequented the lake before Yellowstone became a park. Here the trail intersects the South Shore Shoshone Lake Trail. To the left, the South Shore Trail fords the Lewis River and continues 9 miles to Shoshone Geyser Basin. To the right, the South Shore Trail travels .2 miles to an junction with the DeLacy Creek Trail and the Dogshead Trail. To make a loop (and shorten it by 1.5 miles) continue to the right and follow the Dogshead Trail back.\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

This easy, fairly flat 2.5-mile trail leads to good-sized Riddle Lake, a lovely lilypad lake located near the top of the divide.\r\n\nThe trail begins on the western side of the divide and quickly crosses over to the eastern side, although you'll hardly notice. Water on the western side eventually flows to the Pacific Ocean via the Lewis, Snake, and Columbia rivers. On the eastern side, it flows to the Gulf of Mexico via Yellowstone Lake and the Yellowstone, Missouri, and the Mississippi rivers.\r\n\nThe trail travels through dense, mature lodgepole forest, interrupted occasionally by small areas of younger lodgepoles that resulted from earlier forest fires. At the 1.7-mile mark begins to break out of the trees and at 2 miles reaches Riddle Lake. The marshy meadow south of the trail provides good habitat for moose. It also supports a healthy population of moisture-loving flowers like pink shooting star and elephanthead, and purple monkshood.            \r\n\nRiddle Lake is surrounded by meadows on the south, west, and east sides. A good portion of its 274-acre surface is covered with lily pads. It is a lovely setting with Mount Sheridan and the Red Mountains as a backdrop. Nature is slowly converting the lake to meadows through a process called \"eutrophication.\" Over time, these lilies, together with other vegetation and debris washed in by streams, will gradually fill up the lake bottom. Trees and shrubs will encroach from the sides and eventually the lake will be no more. \r\n\nThe lake is also a great place to observe waterfowl, including white pelican, osprey, blue heron, sandhill crane, and an occasional bald eagle.\r\n\nIn the 1800s, early explorers wrote about a lake that sat directly on the Continental Divide, whose waters flowed to both oceans. Early map-makers thought this was such a lake. Others thought it was a riddle as to which side of the divide it sits, since it had no apparent outlet. Upon closer observation, however, a small stream was found to sneak out of the meadow on its eastern side. This stream flows to Yellowstone Lake, hence the riddle was solved. Naturally, they named the creek \u201cSolution Creek.\u201d\r\n\nThe trail continues another .5 miles along the northern shore of Riddle Lake to its end at 2.5 miles.\r\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

The basin contains some of Yellowstone\u2019s most interesting and beautiful hot springs, but none of its geysers are frequent or predictable.   \r\n\nThe following are descriptions of a number of important features you'll see as you work your way around the basin in a clockwise direction:\r\n\nAbyss Pool - One of the deeper hot springs in the park, Abyss Pool descends to 53 feet. It varies from turquoise blue to emerald green to various shades of brown. In 1883, a park visitor described it as \"a great, pure, sparkling sapphire rippling with heat.\"\r\n\nBlack Pool - Not long ago, Black Pool really was black. Lower water temperature allowed thick mats of dark green and brown thermophiles (heat-loving microorganisms) to grow in the pool, causing it to appear black. The water temperature rose in1991, killing these organisms. Black Pool also erupted that summer and several times the following winter.\r\n\nFishing Cone - Mountain men told of a geyser on the shore of a high alpine lake where one could catch a trout, swing the pole around, dip it into the boiling pool, and cook the fish without taking it off the line. This cooking-on-the-hook feat at Fishing Cone became famous after it was described by a member of the 1870 Washburn Expedition. Visitors often dressed in a cook's hat and apron to have their picture taken at the \"Chowder Pot\" or the \"Fish Pot.\" Anglers often injured themselves while straddling the boiling water, and their feet damaged the geyser's cone. Fishing is no longer allowed from Fishing Cone.\r\n\nLakeside Spring - Its blue-green pool of thermal water drains into Yellowstone Lake. The colors you see in the pools of West Thumb are created, in part, by what grows in these hot waters. Thermophiles have different colors and different temperature requirements. Generally, green and brown indicate organisms living in cooler water, orange and yellow indicate those living in hotter water.\r\n\nBlue Funnel Spring - This was long known for the distinctive ring of color around its perimeter. However, when Abyss pool began erupting during the winter of 1991-92, the water in Blue Funnel, and in adjacent Perforated Pool and Ephedra Spring, cooled and sank well below the rim. Then the four features appeared to exchange energy: Abyss stopped erupting at the  end of that winter, while these features were rejuvenated.\r\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

This short 1.5-mile trail leads 200 feet up to a spectacular view of West Thumb. \r\n\nThe trail leaves the parking lot and travels 0.2 miles through the forest to a crossing of the South Entrance Road. Be careful here, the traffic may be distracted looking for animals or attempting to decide which way to turn at the West Thumb intersection.\r\n\nAt the trail junction turn right, cross a small creek on a log bridge, and continue into the forest. At the 1/2 mile mark the trail starts to open up as it climbs more steeply. Soon you\u2019ll enter the first of several thermal areas of mostly dry springs and mud pots. Notice the large supply of buffalo dung in the area. The ground here is a bit warmer than the surrounding hills, resulting in less snow cover in the winter. Buffalo congregate in spots like this throughout Yellowstone, because it is easer to find forage. Keep a sharp eye out, they like it in the summer too!\r\n\nThe trail continues to climb and at the .8-mile mark reaches the top. Here you\u2019ll find a nice bench on which to rest and enjoy the view. The main attraction is the deep blue waters of West Thumb. This portion of the lake gets its name because Yellowstone Lake resembles the upside-down palm of your right hand. The Southeast Arm of the lake represents the little finger and the South Arm the next. The rather deformed middle finger is made by the Flat Mountain Arm. Delusion Lake was originally believed to be another arm of the lake, forming the index finger of the hand. It was later discovered to be a separate lake. Because of the earlier mistake, it was named \"Delusion\" Lake. West Thumb, of course, forms the thumb of the hand.\r\n\nNotice how the West Thumb portion of the lake is oval-shaped. It is a younger (150,000 years old) secondary caldera or crater within the larger Yellowstone Caldera which welled-up and blew-out some 630,000 years ago. At 280 feet deep, it holds some of the deepest parts of Yellowstone Lake.\r\n\nThe rugged Absaroka Mountains (pronounced \"AB-sar-O-ka\" or \"ab-SAR-o-ka\") rise above the lake to the east. To your right is Mount Sheridan and the Red Mountains. From the summit, the trail continues southwest down through a nice meadow, bends left into the trees, crosses several log bridges, and ends at the first junction.\r\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

In July 1981, a 24-year old man jumped head-first into this 202-degree pool in an ill-fated attempt to rescue his dog. He sustained 3rd degree burns over 100 percent of his body and died the next morning. This is an important reminder to stay on the boardwalks for your safety. \r\n\nContinue straight at the junction and soon you'll see Silex Spring. This clear pool reveals it\u2019s beautiful hard rock bottom, made of silicon dioxide, or silica. \u201cSilex\u201d is Latin for silica. Just up the hill is the star of the show \u2013 the Fountain Paint Pot. It is one of the largest and most colorful mudpots in the park. In early summer it is watery from abundant rain and snow. By late summer, it\u2019s \u201cbloops\u201d and \u201cbloups\u201d are quite thick. The mud is composed of clay minerals and fine particles of silica.\r\n\nJust beyond the mudpot, you\u2019ll find a fumarole, or steam vent. The hiss and roar of a fumarole comes from gases - steam, carbon dioxide, and a little hydrogen sulfide - rushing from the earth through the vent. Take the boardwalk to the right to view Leather Pool. This spring underwent dramatic changes after the Hebgen Lake earthquake of 1959. Prior to the earthquake, it was a warm pool that supported leather-like brown bacteria. After the earthquake, water temperatures rose to boiling and killed the microorganisms. Since that time, Leather Pool has cooled and once again supports the brown bacteria.\r\n\nNext up is Red Spouter, which was born during the Hebgen earthquake. In the spring and early summer its pools splash muddy water that often has a red tone. Later in the summer, when the water table is lower, Red Spouter becomes a hissing fumarole.\r\n\nDown the hill you'll find Clepsydra geyser in almost constant eruption from several vents. Its name is Greek for water clock, because the geyser used to erupt regularly every three minutes. Since the 1959 Hebgen earthquake, however, Clepsydra erupts almost without pause. Nearby Jet Geyser, during its active period, erupts every few minutes up to 20 feet.\r\n\nFrom Clepsydra, the trail loops back to the left and continues to the parking area.\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

This mostly paved path was used as an auto road until 1971. Today pedestrians and bicyclists enjoy a pleasant trip along a beautifully serene stretch of the Firehole River to reach Lone Star Geyser. \r\n\nThe trail closely follows the Firehole River through a forest partially burned by the 1988 fires. The man-made structures you'll notice in the river are part of an old drinking-water system for the Old Faithful area. The trail remains close to the river as it twists and turns its way past you to reach the Upper Geyser Basin. At the .5 mile mark the trail makes a bridged crossing of the river. At 1.6 miles the Spring Creek Trail joins from the left. Continue straight and follow the trail as it bends to the right and affords nice views of a small meadow through which the Firehole runs. \r\n\nAt the 2.5 mile mark, Lone Star Geyser is reached. Bicyclists will have to park their bikes at the bike rack before continuing to the geyser. As a Texan I was disappointed to learn that \"Lone Star\" Geyser was not named after my home state, but rather because it is a significant geyser that stands alone, away from the large concentration of geysers down river. Lone Star's 10-foot geyser cone is one of the largest in Yellowstone, indicating that this geyser has been erupting here for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years. And its 45 foot eruptions which shoot from the top of the cone are well worth the wait.\r\n\nLone Star Geyser erupts about every 3 hours. Look for the log book maintained by the Park Service to see if previous visitors have noted the time of the last eruption. The geyser itself will also give you a clue of its pending eruption. It generally begins splashing about 90 minutes prior to eruption and builds for the big event. Eruptions last about 5 minutes and are followed by a loud steam phase that can be heard a mile away.\r\n\nThe trail continues another .2 miles near a number of hot springs and small geysers and ends at a junction with the Shoshone Lake Trail and the Howard Eaton Trail to Old Faithful.\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

Thereafter, you'll reach a deep, dark blue spring marked \"Sapphire Pool.\" Until the big earthquake of August 1959, it was a very hot but relatively small geyser, surrounded by a delicate buildup of silicon dioxide scalloping that resembled small biscuits. Following the quake, explosive eruptions occurred, reaching a height of 150 feet. Attendance for its frequent displays rivaled even that of Old Faithful. But alas, Sapphire's eruptive powers waned with time and by the mid-1960s it had returned to its passive pre-earthquake character. None of the delicate scalloping that gave the basin its name survived the violent eruptions.\r\n\nJust past the junction with the loop trail, as it joins from the right, Jewel Geyser is reached. It is named for the lovely beads of sinter around its vent. A bit further on the left is Shell Geyser. Its fun to guess the names of features or to look for the namers reasoning. Can you see the resemblance to a yellow clam shell? Next are Silver Globe Spring and Avoca Spring. \r\n\nAt the trail junction stay right and loop around the boardwalk. There is also more subtle activity in geyser basins. Look closely, you may discover a small dark-colored shore fly. A \"vegetarian,\" the fly feeds on the algae and bacteria that thrive here. With luck, you may also spot a wolf spider, tiger beetle, or a bird known as a killdeer. These are the \"carnivores\" of  the basin. They prey on shore flies and their orange-colored eggs for nourishment. Many of these life forms are so perfectly adapted to the basin, they can be found in no other environment.\r\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

It contains two of Yellowstone\u2019s largest hydrothermal features - Grand Prismatic Spring and Excelsior Geyser.\r\n\nFrom the parking area, the path crosses the Firehole River. Notice the large volume of thermal runoff water rushing to meet the river. Just up the hill, Excelsior Geyser discharges more than 4,000 gallons of water per minute into the river, making it one of the most prolific hot springs in the world.  \r\n\nAs you reach the top of the hill, Excelsior Geyser reveals its gaping 200 by 300 crater. Now dormant for over 125 years, for a brief period in the 1880s, Excelsior was one of the largest geysers in the world. Its explosive eruptions sometimes measured 300 feet high and 300 feet wide! Then Park Superintendent Norris named the new attraction, stating that he found it \u201cso immeasurably excelling any other [geyser], ancient or modern, known to history, that I find but one name fitting, and herein christen it the 'Excelsior.'\u201d \r\n\nThe boardwalk bends to the left around the side of Excelsior then bends back to the right to reach  Grand Prismatic Spring. This enormous spring measures over 370 feet across and 120 feet deep, making it the second largest hot spring in the world. Notice its brilliant colors. Early visitors to the park were told it was \u201cso dazzling that the eye cannot endure it.\u201d Most of the colors you see are caused by bacteria which thrive in the hot water. Certain types of bacteria are found in extreme temperatures, including boiling water. The less tolerant photosynthetic cyanobacteria (commonly called blue-green algae) survive in Yellowstone's thermal pools in temperatures up to 167\u00b0 F. At that temperature, it is normally a light yellow color. The water cools as it moves farther from its source. Soon orange, red and finally green colors are found near the outer edge of the spring.\r\n\nLook closely, even the steam over Grand Prismatic reflects the brilliant colors of the pool. In 1839, mountain man, Osborne Russell described it this way, \u201cAt length we came to a boiling lake about 300 ft. in diameter... The steam which arose from it was of three distinct colors from the west side for one third the diameter it was white, in the middle it was pale red, and the remaining third on the east light sky blue...\u201d\r\n\nFrom Grand Prismatic, the trail loops back to the right and continues to the parking area.\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

The 150 active geysers that lie here comprise more than 25% of the world's total and include some of the largest and most predictable geysers. \r\n\nOld Faithful Geyser was named by the 1870 Washburn Expedition who wrote: \"we emerged from the woods opposite Old Faithful just as it was giving vent to its internal motions. From that time our spirits rose and all our personal woes and sufferings were forgotten.\" For over 145 years, Old Faithful's regular, predictable eruptions have had a similar effect on millions of Yellowstone visitors. Other geysers with eruptions large enough to identify from the point include Castle, Beehive, and Giantess, all of which were also named by the Washburn Expedition. \r\n\nOld Faithful erupts to between 106 and 184 feet (average height is 130 feet). Each eruption lasts between 1.5 to 5 minutes. The interval between eruptions is 60 to 110 minutes. Before the 1959 Hebgen Lake earthquake, the average interval was about one hour. That quake, and the 1983 Mount Borah quake, caused its average interval to slow to 78 minutes. Although not the largest geyser in the park, Old Faithful is the most frequent and predictable large geyser in Yellowstone and richly deserves its fame. \r\n\nAs you wait for the geyser to erupt, contemplate for a moment another of nature's forces. On September 7, 1988, wild fire attacked this area with a vengeance. Fanned by wind gusts of up to 70 mph, a massive wall of fire descended on the Old Faithful Area from Madison Plateau to the southwest. It roared across this large valley, jumped the Firehole and climbed this ridge. There was nothing man could do to stop it. In fact, it took a herculean effort and a lot of luck to save the Old Faithful Inn.\r\n\nAfter enjoying the view, continue on the trail as it loops back down.\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

It proceeds past a group of geysers on the left. Daisy Geyser erupts at an angle to a height of 75 feet for 3-5 minutes. Typically, Daisy is quite predictable, with eruption intervals of 110 - 240 minutes. \r\n\nAn exception to this is when nearby Splendid Geyser erupts. Splendid Geyser's eruptions are, at times, over 200 feet in height, making it among the tallest geysers in Yellowstone. Its eruptions are infrequent and difficult to predict except for the fact that it is more likely to erupt when a storm front rapidly reduces the barometric pressure in the area. This slightly reduces the boiling temperature in the plumbing system and occasionally triggers a splendid eruption. \r\n\nComet Geyser is a member of the Daisy Group which also contains Daisy and Splendid Geysers. Comet has the largest cone of the three but has, by far, the smallest eruptions. The nearly constant splashing of Comet over a long period of time has resulted in its large cone. Eruptions rarely exceed 6 feet in height. \r\n\nThese geysers may be seen more closely from the boardwalk on the far side. A junction with that trail is just ahead.\r\n\nJust under 0.4 miles from the start, the trail reaches the Punch Bowl Spring Connector to the unusual Punch Bowl Spring, a frequently visited spot before the highway was converted to a trail. This boiling, intermittent, spring has produced a sinter lip that raises it above the basin floor.

It follows the Firehole past several campsites and enters a lovely meadow at the 1.5-mile mark. It skirts the east side of the meadow for a 1/4 mile then enters the forest and begins a steady 350-foot climb over the next mile. It continues over rolling terrain another 1/2 mile to Grants Pass on the Continental Divide at the 3.3-mile mark. \r\n\nThe pass was named for President Grant, who signed the bill creating Yellowstone on March 1, 1872. Although the unmarked pass is not picturesque, you truly are on top of the world. Water from the Firehole River behind you flows to the Gulf of Mexico via the Madison, Missouri, and the Mississippi rivers. The drainage ahead of you eventually flows west to the Pacific Ocean via Shoshone Creek, and the Lewis, Snake, and Columbia rivers.\r\n\nFrom the pass, the trail gradually descends 200 feet over 3 miles to the geyser basin. Along the way it passes a junction with the Bechler River Trail (on the right at 4 miles), and the Shoshone Geyser Basin Horse Cutofff Trail (on the right at 5 miles) and follows Shoshone Creek into a nice-sized meadow. At the 6-mile mark the trail passes North Shore Shoshone Lake Trail on the left, then quickly bears right and enters Shoshone Geyser Basin.\r\n\nAt least one hour is necessary to explore the many geysers and hot springs on either side of Shoshone Creek. The 1878 Hayden Survey named many of these features. The largest geyserite deposit in the basin belongs to Minuteman Geyser, which you'll see first. During its active phase its irruptions almost live up to the name. Union Geyser, with three conspicuous cones, lies on the same side of the creek at the south end of the basin. Though its eruptions are rare, an occasional backpacker is treated to a spectacular sight. All three cones erupt simultaneously. On the opposite side of the creek, Lion Geyser and Bronze Geyser occasionally erupt.\r\n\nThe trail continues south through a meadow, across Shoshone Creek, and ends at an intersection with the South Shore Shoshone Lake Trail.

It shares a trailhead with the Divide Trail.\n\nThis Spring Creek Trail is primarily used as a winter ski trail (skiers can get a snowcoach drop at the trailhead and ski 7 miles downhill to Old Faithful using the Spring Creek, Lone Star Geyser and Kepler Cascade trails). However, it also makes a pleasant summer hike along a lovely small creek on a trail once used as an old stagecoach road.\n\nFrom the trailhead, head south .1 mile, cross Spring Creek, and turn right at the trail junction. From here the trail makes a gradual 400-foot descent over the next 4 miles following the creek as it winds its way to meet the Firehole River.\n\nSpring Creek was named by members of the 1885 USGS Hague Survey for the large amount of water coming out from beneath the rhyolite rock found on the south side of the creek. The trail, which crosses back and forth across the small creek numerous times, follows an old 1891 stagecoach road. The road was later moved north to follow the current highway, and this trail was used by horse parties and later by hikers. A number of the old wooden bridges remain, but over time they have decayed and many are no longer passable, making this otherwise easy hike a bit of a pain at times.\n\nAt the 1.6-mile mark the trail enters a shallow canyon and closely follows the creek. As the canyon becomes deeper and the trail makes a brief climb above the creek (around the 2.2-mile mark), keep an eye out to the left along the creek for a sharp pinnacle of rock. This is Turtle Rock. A keen observer will be able to make out the shape of a turtle in the rock about eye-level with the trail. At this spot in 1908 the largest stagecoach holdup in history occurred. The bandit, who was never caught, robbed 17 stagecoaches, one after the other, taking more than $2,000 from 174 tourists.\n\nFrom Turtle Rock, the trail continues beck and forth across the creek and eventually reaches a bridged crossing of the Firehole River near the mouth of the creek as it empties into the Firehole. Just beyond the bridge, the trail terminates at the junction with the Lone Star Geyser Trail. To the left, Lone Star Geyser lies just under a mile away. To the right, the trail leads 1.6 miles to the highway near Kepler Cascades.\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

From the Biscuit Basin parking area, cross the Firehole River on the footbridge and continue along the boardwalk to the far side of the basin. About 0.2 miles from the parking area, near Avoca Spring, turn left and follow the Mystic Falls Trail as it leaves the boardwalk and heads into the forest. Continue another 0.1 miles past the Fairy Creek Trail on the right to reach the trailhead to Summit Lake, which splits to the left. \r\n\nThe seldom used Summit Lake Trail is an enjoyable route to the lake and to Smoke Jumper Hot Springs just beyond. However, for the distance and elevation gained, there are many far better trails in Yellowstone.\r\n\nThe Summit Lake Trail begins with a ford of the Little Firehole River (usually doable by late June) followed by a good, 600-foot, climb up the Madison Plateau in the first 1.1 miles. Near the top, intermittent views through the trees to the east of the Upper Geyser Basin may be had. The trail continues to climb for miles, though less steeply, through lodgepole pine forests with pockets of spruce and fir trees and an occasional meadow. Look for through-hikers on the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail (CDT) which uses this trail as part of its 3100-mile trek along the Rocky Mountains between Mexico and Canada.\r\n\nAt the 7.5 mile mark, Summit Lake is reached. The lake, which has no fish, is just over 28 acres in size with a maximum depth of 21 feet. Its elevation is 8552 feet and it lies less than a 1/2-mile from the Continental Divide, hence the name Summit Lake.\r\n\nThe Summit Lake Trail continues west to the Continental Divide (8625'), which is reached at the 8-mile mark. Just past the divide, hikers enter the area known as Smoke Jumper Hot Springs. These partially-dry springs were named in the 1950s because Yellowstone fire fighters who jump into forest fires to battle the blaze use backcountry thermal areas like this as guiding land marks in making their jumps.\r\n\nThe Summit Lake Trail continues another 8 miles through fairly uninteresting terrain before terminating at Yellowstones western boundary. Unless you are traveling along the CDT, its recommended that you turn around here and retrace your steps to the trailhead.\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

It follows an old roadbed 0.9 miles to Morning Glory Pool, then picks up a paved path another 0.2 miles to Grotto Geyser. Just after Grotto, the path makes two quick right turns. From there, it follows a hiking and biking trail another 1.4 miles back to Biscuit Basin, ending at the far side of the basin (about 0.2 miles from the trailhead).\r\n\nThe first 0.9 miles of this trail is infrequently used. It first passes Cauliflower Geyser on the right, then quickly makes a right turn. The Powerline Trail, used mostly by skiers in the winter, is to the left. From the junction, our trail follows an old roadbed that once was part of the main Grand Loop Road leading from Old Faithful. In 1972, to reduce stress on the geyser basin and better direct traffic the NPS constructed the Old Faithful interchange and moved the highway out of the basin.\r\n\nThe trail passes Gem Pool and a number of other thermal features before reaching Artemisia Geyser at the 0.5-mile mark. Here you get a commanding view of the geyser from above. Artemisia is the genus that sagebrush falls under. From this angle, it is possible to understand how the maze of silicon dioxide deposits, which emanate from the pool, cause the spring to resemble that plant. Artemisia erupts impressively to a height of 30 feet about once every 24 hours. Just beyond Artemisia lie two geyserite cones which are collectively known as Atomizer Geyser.  \r\n\nThe trail continues another 0.4 miles over rolling terrain to Morning Glory Pool. Long a favored destination, Morning Glory was named in the 1880s for its remarkable likeness to its namesake flower. This beautiful pool has fallen victim to vandalism. People have thrown literally tons of coins and rocks into the pool. The debris subsequently became embedded in the spring's vent, affecting water circulation and accelerating thermal energy loss. Morning Glory's appearance has changed as its temperature has dropped. Orange and yellow bacteria that formerly colored the periphery of the spring now spread toward its center.\r\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

From here, it does a 0.6-mile, clockwise loop around Old Faithful Geyser, passing the starting point and continuing along the paved path for 0.4 miles to Castle Geyser. The trail turns right, following boardwalks past Crested Pool, crosses the Firehole River, and reaches a junction near Sawmill Geyser 0.2 miles from Castle. At the junction, the trail turns left and continues past numerous features, including Grand Geyser, Economic Geyser, and Beauty Pool, before crossing back over the Firehole 0.4 miles from Sawmill. The trail continues another 0.3 miles, past Giant Geyser and reaches Grotto Geyser. From Grotto, the trail turns left, then immediately right, for its last leg passing Daisy, Comet, and Splendid Geysers before ending at its junction with the Punch Bowl-Black Sand Basin Trail. \r\n\nCheck the Visitor's Center for eruption times for Old Faithful, Castle, and Grand geysers before starting. \r\n\nThe following are important features you'll see along the trail:\r\n\nCastle Geyser has the largest cone and may be the oldest geyser in Yellowstone. Since geyserite cones build up at only 1 to 2 inches every 100 years, we know that Castle is quite old. It erupts every 10-12 hours. Eruptions frequently reach 90 feet and last about 20 minutes. The water phase is followed by a noisy steam phase lasting 30-40 minutes. Members of the 1879 Washburn Expedition named Castle Geyser for its resemblance to the ruins of a feudal castle.\r\n\nGrand Geyser, the tallest predictable geyser in the world, erupts every 7-15 hours. A classic fountain geyser, Grand erupts from a large pool with powerful bursts rather than a steady column like Old Faithful. An average eruption lasts 9-12 minutes and consists of 1-4 bursts, sometimes reaching 200 feet.\r\n\nGiant Geyser was dormant for many years after 1955. Since then, it has slowly become active. In 1997, eruptions occurred every 3-10 days. Eruptions last about an hour and can reach heights of 180-250 feet. Today eruptions are less frequent. \r\n\nGrotto Geyser erupts about every eight hours splashing 10 feet. The weirdly shaped cone that gives the geyser its name is from geyserite covering the trunks of trees that once grew here.\r\n\nDaisy Geyser erupts at an angle to a height of 75 feet for 3-5 minutes. Daisy is quite predictable, with eruption intervals of 110-240 minutes.\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

From the Visitor's Center, go between the geyser and the Old Faithful Lodge, turn right at the first trail junction, and follow the paved path down to a bridged crossing of the Firehole River. Continue straight at the junction with the Observation Point Trail to Geyser Hill. Follow the boardwalk for a counterclockwise loop of Geyser Hill. \r\n\nThe first significant feature along the trail is Giantess Geyser, one of the largest and most powerful geysers in the world. Its infrequent eruptions explode unpredictably from its large pool to a height of 200 feet, 2 to 6 times a year. Its duration lasts many hours and progresses from a water phase to a powerful steam phase.  During eruptions, the seismograph in the visitor center can detect small tremors in the ground and the roar of the steam can be heard more than a mile away. The Washburn Expedition, who named this magnificent feature, exclaimed, \"All we had previously witnessed seemed tame in comparison.\"  \r\n\nThe trail continues past beautiful Doublet Pool (on the left), Aurum Geyser (on the right), the Observation Point Spur trail to Solitary Geyser (on the right) and Ear Spring (left, see the resemblance?) before reaching a junction in the boardwalk. Turn left and immediately view the Lion Group geysers on the right. The Lion Group consists of four geysers: Lion, Lioness, Big Cub, and Little Cub, which are all connected underground. \r\n\nOf these, Lion has the largest cone and eruptions. Active phases normally occur each day. Eruptions of Lion Geyser last 1-7 minutes and are often preceded by sudden gushes of steam and a deep roaring sound, hence the name Lion. Just past the Lion Group lies Heart Spring, named by park geologist, George Marler, because its shape resembles a human heart.\r\n\nThe last important feature on Geyser Hill is Beehive Geyser, a classic cone-type geyser that erupts in a steady column of water through a small vent or geyserite cone. Eruptions usually occur twice each day with displays lasting 4-5 minutes. During an eruption, the narrow cone acts like a nozzle, projecting the water column to heights of 130-190 feet. Shortly past Beehive the trail concludes its loop of Geyser Hill.\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

It can be used to make a loop with the Upper Geyser Basin Trail. It can also be used to connect with the Upper Geyser Basin-Biscuit Basin Trail for a hike to Biscuit Basin or the Punch Bowl-Black Sand Basin Trail for a hike to Black Sand Basin.\r\n\nThe trail begins at Castle Geyser, which has the largest cone and may be the oldest geyser in Yellowstone. Since geyserite cones build up at only 1 to 2 inches every 100 years, we know that Castle is quite old. It erupts every 10-12 hours. Eruptions frequently reach 90 feet and last about 20 minutes. The water phase is followed by a noisy steam phase lasting 30-40 minutes. Members of the 1879 Washburn Expedition named Castle Geyser for its resemblance to the ruins of a feudal castle.\r\n\nThe paved path you are following away from Old Faithful was once a part of Yellowstone's Grand Loop Road. In 1972, to reduce stress on the geyser basin, better control traffic, and make this pedestrian/bike path, the NPS constructed the Old Faithful interchange and moved the highway out of the basin.\r\n\nAs you follow the trail, you pass the Orange Springs group of hot springs on the left. Soon you are skirting the Firehole River on the right. Because the Firehole receives large volumes of thermal water runoff, the river never freezes, even at 60 degrees below zero.\r\n\nA little over 0.5 miles from Castle Geyser, you'll pass a trail junction with Punch Bowl-Black Sand Basin Trail on your left. Continue straight another 0.1 miles to the trail's end near Grotto Geyser. \r\n\nEarly explorers were baffled by the unusual shape of Grotto Geysers silicon dioxide build up. Take a moment to study it - what do you suppose caused the irregularity? The NPS was curious about this also. Some years ago they bore a tiny hole in the geyserite and took a core sample. Inside the formation were the remains of once living trees! When this geyser began actively erupting there were several small trees close by. The spray from the geyser hit the trees. Eventually, enough silicon dioxide was deposited on them that they began to bed and slump closer and closer to the geyser. With a little imagination you can make out the shape of these trees.The large blunt shape near the center of the feature is most likely a tree stump. Grotto Geyser erupts about every eight hours splashing up to 10 feet.\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

John lived in the cabin until 1895 when he finished his main residence, and it later became a smithy and barn.\r\n\nCunningham ran a profitable ranch until drought ruined his crops and cattle prices fell at the end of World War I. As an agricultural depression persisted through the 1920s, Cunningham and other ranchers recognized the valleys potential as a playground. Cunningham teamed up with neighbor Josiah David Si Ferrin to write a petition signed by 97 valley ranchers. The petition proposed a buyout of ranches to create a national recreation area for public enjoyment. In 1928, Cunningham sold to the Snake River Land Company who later donated 35,000 acres for park expansion.\r\n\nTwo Montana wranglers approached Cunningham in the fall of 1892 to purchase hay. Cunningham allowed the strangers to winter on his ranch. However, rumors spread that the men were horse thieves. Next spring, a man claiming to be a U.S. Marshal, with three deputies, rode into Jackson from Idaho. Joined by Jackson recruits, the marshals men surrounded the ranch at night.

Follow the arrow to Dads Lake to hike this CDT: Big Sandy to North Fork Lake (WY Sec. 13). The first three miles is a serious uphill through the pine forest with a lot of blowdown from a freak windstorm in early September 2020. Thanks to the NFS, the trail itself is cleared of blowdown.\r\n\nAt the 3.0 mile mark, the trail levels off as it pops out of the forest into grassy meadows and views of distant peaks, which is the theme of most of this CDT section.  Tiny Mirror Lake is passed, then Dads Lake and Marms Lake, both with good camping.\r\n\nLeaving Marms Lake behind at the 7.0 mile mark, lakes and water become scarcer for the next nine miles as the trail travels over high rocky, grassy meadows with great views of the peaks of the Continental Divide to the right/east. The trail drops briefly to cross Washakie Creek, a great place to fill up on water and take a break, at the 9.0 mile mark. After Washakie Creek there are a couple small creeks, and the next lake is Cross Lake, about five miles further on at the 14.0 mile mark. However, Cross Lake is about a quarter mile away from the trail to the west. Soon after Cross Lake comes Raid Lake at the 16.0 mile mark, and a cute little lake at its north end. These are the beginnings of the frequent lakes and water sources for the rest of this section.\r\n\nStill in the rocky, grassy meadows, Dream Lake, followed by Bobs Lake and Sandpoint Lake, along with side trails to Middle Fork Lake, are soon passed over the next three miles. Halls Creek, a large creek in a lovely green valley, is reached at the 21.0 mile mark. \r\n\nThen comes a one mile climb up the forested Halls Butte. Traveling over little ups and downs, Pipestone Lakes and unmarked side trails- Valley Lake Trail, to pretty Valley Lake to the east, are passed. Then at the 24.4 mile mark the trail begins a one mile descent through the trees, to come out into meadows and first views of North Fork Lake.\r\n\nThe trail then heads to North Fork Lake, but before reaching the lake it must cross the lake's wide inlet creek cascading down from Victor Lake. North Fork Lake is reached at the 25.7 mile mark, and the trail runs along the lake's north end for almost a half mile. Just as the trail finishes passing North Fork Lake, a signed trail junction with Victor Lake Trail #7115 is reached.

From North Fork Lake, the trail climbs to Hat Pass at the 2.6 mile mark. Like all the passes along this CDT section, Hat Pass is a treeless, grassy, boulder strewn pass. \r\n\nFrom Hat Pass, the trail descends into a more treed stretch, crosses a major creek, and then climbs to three unnamed passes in a row at the 6.2, 7.0, and 7.8 mile marks.  There are great views of the rugged Wind River Range peaks from these passes, especially the last one. Descending from the last unnamed pass, one is in Bald Mountain Basin, a treeless, rocky, grassy basin, dotted with many small lakes, and surrounded by peaks, including Angel Peak on the Continental Divide.\r\n\nLeaving Bald Mountain Basin, the trail descends into a short treed section, crosses Pole Creek, passes a couple lakes, and climbs to Lester Pass at the 13.0 mile mark. Descending from Lester Pass one comes to a major trail junction with the trail to Island Lake/Titcomb Basin and joins it for a short ways. Then leaving the crowds bound for Island Lake behind, the trail winds around past trees, lakes, and meadows, and comes to Fremont Creek, crossing it on a sturdy bridge.\r\n\nAfter Fremont Creek, the trail climbs gradually to Lower Jean Lake, set in a rocky, grassy basin with scattered trees, runs along the lake high above it for almost a mile, crosses its inlet creek a couple times, and heads to Upper Jean Lake. Continuing to climb gradually, the trail is now in treeless, rocky, grassy terrain for the next four miles. Upper Jean Lake is passed, and then another small lake, and then the trail reaches a high point with a view of Shannon Pass ahead, at the 21.4 mile mark. \r\n\nBut instead of going over Shannon Pass, the trail veers left/west and heads to Elbow Lake, the largest lake in a treeless, grassy, rocky basin dotted with many lakes. At the 23.3 mile mark, the trail descends out of the Elbow Lake Basin, winds around, and makes a final descent to cross the upper reaches of the forested Pine Creek Valley and Pine Creek.\r\n\nAfter crossing Pine Creek, the trail climbs out of its forested valley into the rocky, treelless, grassy high lands again.

The road to the trailhead requires highish clearance and low clearance vehicles should park at Spring Creek/Willow Lake Junction. From there, hike the road to the TH, which is approximately an extra 1.5 miles.   \r\n\nThe trail proper starts as an undulating singletrack that criss-crosses the road for ~1 mile. The trail then begins ascending through aspen groves and pine forest area. You'll hit the road again, but where the trail begins again is fairly obvious. You can ascend road instead of trail for the first mile if you only want; this cuts off a bit of distance.  The climb to the wilderness boundary is relatively gradual but demanding. However, the reward is in the views and the descent.  The trail traverses along beautiful grade reversal after grade reversal with relatively little switchbacking.  \r\n\nClimb out of the forest to an awesome ridge with views to Fremont Lake below, White Pine to the south and the Wind River Peaks to the East.  You just can't beat the scenery. The trail continues down to the forest and heads back out onto ridge for approximately a mile then dives back into the woods to continue up and out to an exposed bench cut that leads to the wilderness boundary.  \r\n\nHere, at the wilderness boundary, the 3.6 mile mark, just turn around and enjoy the hike back. It's at times rocky, but overall it's a very lovely descent with a nice grade. Or continue on into the high country for another 10.5 miles to Summit Lake.\r\n\nContinuing on past the wilderness boundary, the trail climbs gradually in the pine forest to overlook, and then descend to Glimpse Lake at the 5.9 mile mark. Then beginning to climb gradually again, almost immediately, still in the forest, the trail reaches a trail sign. Here, a very short side trip to the south (Elkhart Park direction on the sign) leads to Crows Nest Lookout, a rocky bluff overlooking the Pine Creek drainage/valley, with awesome views. To continue on the trail to Summit Lake, return to the trail sign and go towards Trapper Lake.\r\n\nLeaving Crows Nest Lookout behind, climbing gradually, the trail goes through pine forest and rocky, grassy meadows for the next 8.1 miles to its end point at Summit Lake.

After crossing Boulder Creek, look for the trailhead sign on the right.\r\n\nStarting off in the high flats and brush of the land west of the Wind Rivers, for the first five miles Boulder Canyon Trail climbs very gradually as it follows Boulder Creek upstream. Within the first mile, Boulder Creek is crossed twice to end up on the north side of the creek, where it remains. At about the 1.5 mile mark the trail moves away from the creek, and passes a long, wet, marshy area on the left.\r\n\nAfter passing the wet marshy area, Boulder Canyon Trail returns to the creek at about the 2.5 mile mark. Now in more wooded and hilly terrain, the steep hillsides of the creek valley start to close in as one is now in Boulder Creek Canyon. Here, the trail runs close to the creek for the next two and a half miles.\r\n\nAt the 5.0 mile mark, Boulder Canyon Trail veers north to follow another creek - Boulder Creek North Fork. Following this new creek, the trail climbs steeply up to the shelf where the Lake Ethel Trail #7164 junction is found at the 6.3 mile mark, as Boulder Creek North Fork cascades down mini-falls to the right of the trail, to empty into Boulder Creek. Boulder Creek North Fork is the outlet creek of Lake Ethel that is just beyond the trail junction if one goes left onto Lake Ethel Trail #7164. To continue on Boulder Canyon Trail, go right at this trail junction.\r\n\nLeaving the Lake Ethel Trail #7164 trail junction behind, Boulder Canyon Trail is temporarily flat as it crosses the cascades of Boulder Creek North Fork on a sturdy bridge. A small lake, Dugway Lake, is passed on the left and the trail begins to climb again. The terrain is more open and barren from here until the end of the trail. As the trail climbs, the Boulder Creek North Fork valley, with Lake Ethel in it, is below, to the left, and the rocky hillsides rise to the right.\r\n\nAt the 8.0 mile mark, Boulder Canyon Trail, veers right to climb over a ridge. After about a half mile, the Pipestone Creek valley appears below.  Pipestone Creek is another Boulder Creek tributary. Here, at the 8.5 mile mark, the trail veers left, and high above Pipestone Creek, continuing to climb in the open rocky terrain, the trail follows Pipestone Creek upstream. \r\n\nPipestone Creek is the outlet creek of Lake Vera, a tiny lake where Boulder Canyon Trail ends at a trail junction with Highline Trail #7094 .", "features": "Commonly Backpacked \u00b7 Lake \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Waterfall \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7071786/tiny-lake-vera-boulder-canyon-trail-ends-here-at-a-trail-junction-with-highline-", "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 9.7, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [9687, 7312], "alt-change": [2539, 197], "avg-grade": 5.0, "max-grade": 21.0}},

Going in this direction, hiking Crows Nest Lookout Trail is a steep climb from start to finish. But the views get better and better the higher one gets, culminating with the awesome views from Crows Nest Lookout at the trail's end.\r\n\nCrows Nest Lookout Trail is found at the 3.3-mile mark along the trail to Long Lake #7122. There is a trail sign at this trail junction - follow the arrow towards Trapper Lake to begin hiking Crows Nest Lookout Trail.

After crossing the creek, continuing in the forest, the trail begins climbing immediately. And doesn't stop climbing until it reaches its other end at Crows Nest Lookout.\r\n\nAs Crows Nest Lookout Trail climbs, it emerges from the forest into grassy, rocky open areas with low sage brush in places. Once in the open, the views to the southeast get better and better, as one goes higher and higher. These views are of the Pine Creek drainage. This valley has been carved by Pine Creek and its tributaries such as Fremont Creek, Bridger Creek, and other creeks. Several small lakes are along these creeks.  \r\n\nAs one approaches the end of Crows Nest Lookout Trail, Triangle Lake and Long Lake are visible. Also towards the trail's end, as the trail levels out, it enters the pine forest for short stretches.

Climbing gradually, the trail moves away from the creek to go around the east side of a small lake in the grassy meadows at the 0.5 mile mark.\r\n\nContinuing to climb very gradually, Hay Pass Trail runs through stretches of thin forest, willows, and grassy, rocky areas for the next two and a half miles. Traveling in the creek valley, a dramatic, steep, rocky mountain ridge forming the valley's west side is seen in the open areas. North Fork Peak is at the south end of the ridge, and Round Top Mountain is near the north end.  The very north end goes to the Continental Divide forming the west side of Hay Pass.\r\n\nAt the 3.0 mile mark, Lake 10322 comes into view in the meadows ahead.  The trail turns left to circle around the lake, crossing the creek again, which is this lake's outlet creek here. Then veering right, the trail follows the lake's west shoreline beneath the towering ridge to the west, And finally, the trail veers right again to go along the north side of the lake for a short ways.\r\n\nLeaving Lake 10322 behind, at the 3.5 mile mark the trail bends left/north to climb more steeply on the rocky, grassy slopes towards Hay Pass that can be seen ahead.  The shelf ahead on the left/west holds Beth Lake (Lake 10755). At the 4.2 mile mark, the Beth Lake output creek is reached.  The creek is shallow and wide with no obvious trail across it.

Impressive views of Beth Lake with Round Top Mountain and the rocky mountain ridge rising from its west shoreline are to be admired. Looking back/south, Mt. Victor is the massive mountain on the valley's east side. \r\n\nContinuing to climb, the trail continues over the rocks with thinner grass now, towards Hay Pass.

This is Valley Lake Trail. Valley Lake Trail is a relatively flat trail until a small hill at the very end. Heading off into the grass, there are pretty stands of pines along the way, good for getting some shade from the bright sun up here.  Valley Lake comes into view after only about a tenth of a mile.  It is a pretty lake with an irregular shoreline, off to the right/east.

The trail starts with a creek crossing of Crystal Creek, which can be fast and high with snow melt so be prepared to explore downstream for wider, shallower sections. \r\n\nOnce across, head south through the meadow toward the first forested hill climb. This section is steep and loose. Take your time and watch your footing.

Continuing southeast, the trail maintains a nice, flat grade with a lingering feeling that you aren't the only animal around. After around 2.4 miles, the trail ducks into the intermittent shade as it begins to climb a little toward the confluence with Jagg Creek and the Jagg Creek Trail. There are two intersections to continue on this trail. The first can be taken in either direction, left or right. Heading right goes down to the creek with more creek crossings and the left goes to the intersection with Jagg Creek Trail.\r\n\nAt this second intersection, just before the four-mile mark, you'll come to an intersection with Jagg Creek Trail. Head right across the creek toward the large Crystal Creek landslide to the south, which marks the northern end of the ridge up to Crystal Peak (10,968'). The trail continues to bend around the eastern base of Crystal Peak along the creek with access to the West Fork Crystal Creek Trail #4017 around the 8.4-mile mark, which heads west below Pyramid Peak (11,098') to the Flat Creek Trail #4015. \r\n\nFinally, the trail tops out at the intersection with the Swift Creek Trail #4020, Shoal Falls Trail #4119, and the Gros Ventre River Trail #4081.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Commonly Backpacked \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7033332/tongues-out-for-the-lookout-above-crystal-creek", "ratings": {"rating": 4.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 12.9, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [9278, 7185], "alt-change": [2488, 394], "avg-grade": 4.0, "max-grade": 37.0}},

This makes for a great spot to dip your toes or throw a few flies, though the mosquitoes can be rough if there's no breeze. Through this stretch, there may be a couple trails to follow but keep a southern trajectory and you'll find yourself back on the true trail without much trouble.  \r\n\nContinue past the turnoff for the Teepee Creek Trail around the 3.3-mile mark, into more flat, creekside meadow past a couple backcountry horse camps. Look for the clear signage at a couple forks in the trail. At the 4.3-mile mark, the trail heads east into the trees away from the creek valley with some moderate climbing around the east side of a ridge that separates The Six Lakes. Use the Six Lakes Trail to access these beautiful backcountry lakes for a nice camping opportunity. \r\n\nWith one final dogleg left (east) turn, the trail continues upward leaving Jagg Creek to join Bear Cabin Creek with views of Black Peak (11,638') to the south.

The name of the street is called Round Top Drive. Follow the road until you see the turn and pull in the round parking area. There are no bathrooms or any facilities available. There is a monument at the bottom that tells the history of Round Top hill. \r\n\nThe trail starts at the base of the hill where you park. The trail starts with a vigorous climb and slowly morphs to a smaller singletrack that edges along the side of the hill, so you'll not want to be going up when someone is coming down. The trail has no room for passing or moving off of the trail. \r\n\nThe hill is mostly red dirt with granite rocks and fossilized mud. As this is a hot spring area, you'll smell the sulfur from the hot springs down the road. The ascent up the trail starts immediately, with the climb maintaining a steady rise along the side of the hill. The trail at the bottom has some loose slick soil, but further up and to the top, it is mostly solid rock with good footholds.  \r\n\nThe trail does have some twists, but at this cutback when you come down, you could miss the trail to go down -- a flat rock covers the trail and makes it difficult to see as you are looking down on that area. There is one point where you'll need to climb/crawl up the side for about 5 feet.   \r\n\nThe trail is well traveled, so finding and staying on the trail is fairly easy. If you have any fears of open, high places, this trail has one side on the hill with the other side open to the hill. As you get towards the top, you'll need to do a little rock climbing, but only for about 10 feet -- and the trail has been carved out, so reaching the top is fairly easy. The trail does have great natural hand and feet holds at this point, so it's not too difficult.  \r\n\nWhen you reach the top, you'll get a 360-degree view of Thermopolis and beyond. There are some geological survey medallions from 1906 placed on top as well, and finding the triangulation is a fun little activity. The area has some sagebrush and yucca plants. We did see some lizards and found a snake skin at the top of the hill. \r\n\nComing down is more work than going up because at points you'll need to sit to get down over some rock edges. This is a hike that would be good for fall and spring but not in the winter, as the trail would be slick and snow-covered. Overall, a good hike that should take about 30 minutes with exploring the top and enjoying the view of the area.", "features": "Geological Significance \u00b7 Wildflowers", "condition": "Unknown"}, "ratings": {"rating": 5.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 0.2, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [4996, 4775], "alt-change": [221, 0], "avg-grade": 22.0, "max-grade": 41.0}},

Interpretive signs are scattered along the trails to give the user a detailed description of the Fetterman Massacre that once took place in the approximate location of the trail. \r\n\nThe Fetterman Fight was a battle during Native American Red Cloud's war in 1866. The Cheyenne, Lakota, and Arapaho Indians fought against the soldiers of the United States Army from Fort Phil Kearny to the south. The mission of the U.S. soldiers was to protect travelers and settlers on the Bozeman Trail. \r\n\nToday, the trail serves as a place to not only discover Wyoming history but everything else that makes Wyoming unique. Scenic vistas of the Bighorn Mountains to the west, and endless views of the Wyoming prairie to the east. This trail follows the roots of the pioneer wagons that were laid in the mid 19th century. \r\n\nOnly 20 minutes from the City of Sheridan, this trail is used frequently by runners, bikers, and the casual hiker. Although, it is hidden gem as many do not know of its existence. There are no major challenges to this trail. Since it does follow a ridgeline, there is no tree coverage, so be prepared for wind and sun. You can either make the full loop by going down the hill and coming back up the abandoned road, or, you can go to the end of the ridge and back.

It opens up in a meadow and a left-hand trail pops up. Stay right and then proceed though the singletrack. \r\n\nIt will then drop in elevation slightly but quickly. It then turns left and pops out into a substantial rocky section. Weave through the short pines, cross a new fire break line, and then drop through another rock section to a wet spring. Cows and mosquitoes love this place in the summer. Follow the trail north through the aspens and around the head of the spring, and then descend to the next overlook. Here you can view Sundance Mountain and Inyan Kara Mountain. \r\n\nThe trail at the top of the overlook goes right to a small rock drop and then angles back to a short climb of a hill. The left turn is a contour trail that connects to the other side. \r\n\nFrom here, you'll descend a larger rock section for about 1/8 mile. Then drop onto sandy section of singletrack that filters out to descent through pines to Trail B - Sand Pit Trail .\r\n\nThings to watch for: look for high winds in inclement weather, rock gardens, mountain lions, deer, elk, porcupines and various wildlife. \r\n\nThis excellent piece of trail is primitive and buff.", "features": "Views", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7038523/view-south-of-edge-from-trail-junction", "ratings": {"rating": 5.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 2.6, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [6195, 5673], "alt-change": [85, 543], "avg-grade": 5.0, "max-grade": 21.0}},
