The eruption was so violent that the summit of Mount Katmai collapsed, villages were abandoned, and explosions were heard as far away as Juneau. In the wake of this violence, hardy adventurers and scientists discovered the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, a spectacular ash covered landscape.\r\n\nBackpacking the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes takes a bit of planning as you first have to get to Katmai NP, which requires at least one float plane ride from Anchorage. You'll also likely need to spend a night at Katmai, which is either pricey and/or requires reservations well in advance, in order to take the morning bus ride to the end of the park road that crosses three streams. The park's concessionaire tour bus driver will know where the trailhead is, as it is located about a half a mile from the end of the road where the tour bus stops for lunch. \r\n\nFrom the park road, the trail descends rather quickly through vegetation filled with cow parsnip. Once the terrain flattens, the woods open up and you are able to get a view of the valley. At about mile 1.5, you'll encounter Windy Creek, which is a great place to camp for the return trip. After crossing the creek, the trail takes you up above the creek drainage, and you continue eastward to the valley. The trail follows the base of the Buttress Range and vegetation becomes more and more scarce and the trail becomes more and more sandy.  At mile 6, there is a nice waterfall, which makes for another camping option. From there, there is no distinct trail as there are several destinations: the dilapidated hut, lakes at the base of Mageik, Katmai Pass, Novarupta, Mount Griggs, among others. \r\n\nThis trail is rated difficult due to the hazards present, such as Knife Creek and River Lethe that have resulted in several deaths.

The end of the trail towers above the Winner Creek Trail below, and on clear days, the route commands an amphitheater-like view of several hanging glaciers, Mount Alyeska, and an insider's view into neighboring twenty-mile valley. \r\n\nThe trail can be an excellent winter route, and the lower portions are frequented by bikers and cross country skiers. The upper portion is well packed by snowcat during winters when there is enough snow for Chugach Powder Guides to operate.

Snowcat drivers are pretty friendly guys, but they do need trail users to step to the side of the trail when the are passing through.\r\n\nDuring the spring and summer, the trail can be very primitive, passing through marsh and mud and fallen trees coated by thick carpets of moss. There are several fairly steep sections of the trail, no direction signs, and it can be difficult to find the trail when it opens up into some of the stunning meadows that it crosses through. But there are very few routes above the timberline in this area of Alaska, and very few roads or trails offer the views that this ridge offers! \r\n\nNote: this route splits as soon as it begins to open up in the subalpine.

Although it is not the tallest mountain in the area, it is the most prominent mountain in the Eklutna landscape as it boldly stands in front of its larger sibling, Bashful Peak, centered at the opposite end of the lake from the parking lot. Those interested in attempting this hike need to be aware of not only the physical demands, but also practice good steep trail hiking techniques to avoid dangerous rockfall situations. Also, starting as early as possible will help with rock fall, snow conditions and cloud cover at the summit. \r\n\nThis trail is typically accessed from the East Fork Trail via the Eklutna Lakeside Trail from the Eklutna Lake parking lot. A sizable cairn marks the trail just past the creek bed (dry in early August) coming down from Stiver's gully, which I suppose isn't noticeable if you're not actively looking for it. Cairns mark the way up and eventually you make it out of the brush at the bottom of the talus-filled Stiver's gully. Here, the trail disappears and you just have to find your way up the scree field, which may or may not be covered by snow, depending on the time of year. \r\n\nToward the top of Stiver's Gully, the walls narrow and the potential for dangerous rockfall increases. I've seen some wear climbing helmets, but with the size of the talus here, any impact from a rock could lead to serious injury. The end of the scree field presents another challenge with an exposed, scrambling section with a fixed rope up to a grassy knoll. In August, the rope wasn't necessary but I've read that it helps substantially during the late spring melt. \r\n\nA game trail leads you up and the gully opens. Even in August, we were pleasantly surprised with snow on our path as it was substantially easier than hiking through the talus.  At about 5500 feet, you're more or less out of the bowl and starting the final ascent up the southeast scree slopes of the mountain top to the south ridge. You're rewarded during this final ascent with great views of Bashful and Eklutna Glacier. When you finally reach the top, you hopefully have unbelievable views of Eklutna valley, Knik Valley and glacier, and the tallest peaks in Chugach State Park. \r\n\nThis route has an extremely difficult rating due to its elevation gain, difficult terrain (talus and snow fields), minor scrambling, and a high potential for dangerous rockfall.", "features": "Views", "condition": "Unknown"}, "ratings": {"rating": 5.0, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 3.7, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [7635, 1126], "alt-change": [6534, 25], "avg-grade": 34.0, "max-grade": 102.0}},

While the terrain throughout this section does provide slight changes in grade, it's pretty flat overall as you head through the valley.\r\n\nAfter passing the junction with the trail to Barber Cabin, the trail continues to hug the east side of the valley as it continues south toward Aspen Flats Cabin. Once here, be sure to head down the access trail and check it out! \r\n\nWhen you're ready to continue on, the trail makes a turn toward the east to follow the northern side of the valley on it's way to yet another cabin at Upper Russian Lake. While at this one, be sure to check out the gorgeous views of both the lake and your surrounding mountains. \r\n\nPast the cabin, the trail continues east to reach a junction with the Resurrection River Trail.

Although there is no land access to the park, a short boat ride or kayak is worth the effort. Visitors to the park can explore numerous WWII features including ammunition magazines, lookouts, gun emplacements, and the headquarters command center. The park also offers great opportunities for picnicking and wildlife viewing. Fort Rousseau Causeway SHP is undeveloped.\r\n\nFort Rousseau is part of the Sitka Naval Operating Base and U.S. Army Coastal Defenses National Historic Landmark. In addition to National Historic Landmark status, the fort's significance as the headquarters for the harbor defenses of Sitka during World War II also earned it designation as a State Historical Park in April 2008.\r\n\nThe developed gravel trail ends before the causeway to Makhnati Island. It is recommended to cross this causeway on a falling or low tide. It is impassible at medium to high tide so planning the timing for a crossing is important.
