This trail is bi-directional and the locals hike it in a figure-8 to go both directions for a great workout!\r\n\nHistory: \nSpanish explorer Francisco Vasquez Coronado, in search Quiveria and the Seven Cities of Gold, came to the Smoky Valley in July, 1541. Coronado noted the fertile soil of the valley in his journal indicating it would be perfect for growing grapes.\r\n\nThe highest point in the Spanish Buttes located to the north and west of present-day Lindsborg is Coronado Heights. The hill, which rises 300 feet above the valley floor, is owned and maintained by the Smoky Valley Historical Association. The winding road up Coronado Heights takes you to a picnic, hiking, biking, and sightseeing destination which has been enjoyed by local residents and visitors alike for generations.\r\n\nDuring the Great Depression, the federal government-sponsored Work Progress Administration (WPA) built eating and cooking areas of native sandstone around the top of Coronado Heights in addition to a castle honoring the Spanish explorer. The castle provides shelter with a large interior room featuring a table and a fireplace. It's topped with an open-air second-floor roof, accessible by stairs, providing a spectacular view of the valley and beyond. At night, the city lights of Salina, approximately 12 miles to the north, and McPherson, around 20 miles to the south can be plainly seen from the top of the castle.\r\n\nGroups are welcome to use Coronado Heights for meetings, outings, and special events. Contact the Lindsborg CVB office for information on obtaining permission to use the Heights for these occasions. Informal visits and family gatherings are always welcome and do not require prior approval by the SVHA. Coronado Heights is patrolled by both the Saline County Sherriff's Department and the Lindsborg Police Department. The rules and regulations for the use of the Heights can be found in the Coronado Heights Use Policy.", "condition": "Unknown"}, "ratings": {"rating": 4.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 1.6, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [1594, 1460], "alt-change": [90, 224], "avg-grade": 4.0, "max-grade": 10.0}},

There are no trees at this park as it once was a city dump and penetration of the clay cap is prohibited since this was a dump at one point. It's a little weird, but a great use of the space. To the south is the last drive-in theater in Wichita, The Starlight Drive-In.\r\n\nHistory as shared at the park signage:\r\n\n\"In the early 1900's the City of Wichita was facing a growing problem of waste disposal, a problem common to most other large urban areas in the country.  Landfill \"Dumps\" and \"burn-pits\", both public and private, were not well regulated or monitored and were appearing everywhere.  At one time, it was estimated that there were over fifty dumps operating in and around the City of Wichita.  Although, municipal trash collection service did help reduce unauthorized dumps, disposal was still a problem.  \r\n\nAt this time, Chapin Park was the site of the Dwight Chapin family hog farm.  In an attempt to reduce the volume of waste going into the landfills, an early of form of waste recycling was begun.  An agreement between Dwight Chapin and the City of Wichita provided for all food and organic matter to be collected separately and delivered to the Chapin Hog farm where it was mixed with grain and fed to the Hogs.  This was a common practice, as hogs will eat almost any organic matter, regardless of its state of decomposition.  The remaining refuse was delivered to one of the municipal landfills.  So effectively, the Chapin hog farm was an organic-waste recycling center for the entire city.  This continued until 1952, when issues of disease halted this type of operation nationwide.  \r\n\nWichita's First sanitary landfill\r\n\nIn 1954, the City of Wichita purchased the farm for use as a sanitary landfill.  The first of what could be considered a modern landfill, designed and regulated to control pestilence and pollution.  During this time, the 170-acre site accepted residential, commercial and industrial waste.  The Chapin Landfill operated from 1955 to 1980 when it reached capacity and was closed.  It continued, however, to receive construction and demolition debris until 1987.  In 1988, it was covered with a soil cap averaging 3 feet thick and seeded.  Over the next three decades, it went through a process of settling and venting.  As the underlying waste degraded, it compressed and became more stable.\"  \r\n\nPlease see picture for the rest of the history.", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7065005/a-family-on-the-trail-at-dusk", "ratings": {"rating": 4.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 1.0, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [1289, 1272], "alt-change": [15, 21], "avg-grade": 1.0, "max-grade": 2.0}},

This area has had trouble with ATVs and motorcycles over the years and I'm guessing they have torn through the clay cap and exposed the sand.  \r\n\nIn the middle of the hike, you'll find a whole field of dense briars which the park board identified as wild blackberry vines! I'm excited to explore this area closer to when they'll be ripe this summer! As you continue on, the trees will get bigger and you'll be in among many large cottonwoods and some potentially muddy ground from the lake...I'm guessing the water table is quite shallow here.  \r\n\nThis path ends at the north end of the fishing lake and if you have a state fishing license, you're good to go for fishing!", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Fishing \u00b7 Lake \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7069697/someone-has-been-busy", "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 1.3, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [1424, 1412], "alt-change": [27, 28], "avg-grade": 1.0, "max-grade": 3.0}},

Once we got past that area, it was a much better surface and a very nice hike, but we were on edge every 20 feet or so as water snakes kept bailing off the side of the lake into the water. We got a pic of one of them from a distance and don't believe it was venomous; we think it is a plain-belly water snake. The snakes were all north and a little bit south of the swinging bridge.  \r\n\nThere is another area that you may have to go around using connectors if it's flooded; I'll mark it on the trail.
