There are a few areas with small to medium size rocks though. The landscape is primarily smaller bushes and trees since the mountain is still recovering from a fire a few years back. You can still see burned trees and other plants. This makes it to where you don't get a lot of shade. \r\n\nThe trail begins along a small creek through the trees, but soon begins a series of switchbacks to ascend the mountain for about three quarters of a mile. After this climb, there is a picnic table to the left you can rest at. Here you can choose to go back down or continue the remainder of the climb. \r\n\nThe trail then has an easy, gradual ascent up the mountain for about 1 mile. The trail then goes along the mountain ridge line, which gives you a pretty good view on both sides. However, this is the steepest part of the trail. There is another picnic table and bench at the top with a nice view. Another trail continues back down in the other side of the mountain.

The trail is well blazed White for the most part, and with the exception of one area signs indicate which direction the MB trail runs when there are intersections. However, I will provide some tips for some areas where people occasionally make mistakes. \r\n\nFirst, the map shown here is wrong. If you are running this course clockwise (as from the perspective above) then you need to split LEFT at the intersection with the Ore Loop Trail (blazed Red in the park). One will see signs indicating this at the intersection and the trail will be blazed White and Red for this stretch. Go the wrong way as shown in this map and you'll shed over half a mile. There are signs indicating which direction the MB Trail runs, but it can be easy to make a mistake. \r\n\nSecond, beware at the intersection of the MB Trail and the Creech Hollow trail (blazed Orange in the park). This is the one area I know of where two trails connect but the trail names are not identified on the sign. Rather, the large sign with a map indicates mileage to various locations. At this point, you'll need to turn left (if traveling c-wise) toward the Woodland shelter. You'll see a white blaze up the hill from the sign. This is a spot where many runners accidentally go the wrong way, particularly if running c-wise. \r\n\nFinally, it may be worth noting that going counter-clockwise one will see occasional mile-markers along the trail. They are not always easy to spot but they are there.

The trail also crosses the Hiwassee River on a highway bridge. The Hiwassee River is a designated National Scenic River and is popular with canoe and kayak enthusiasts and with trout fishermen. The community of Reliance has several very old buildings and a small store, Webb Bros, one of very few stores located on the BMT.

The Whigg family once lived on the north edge of this meadow growing their subsistence crops and raising sheep. The old home foundation can be found near the north end of the meadow (WP 61). In the springtime, the flame azalea in this area can intoxicate your senses.  Blackberries and huckleberries abound along the edges of the meadow as well. Bears are especially fond of these, so BE BEAR AWARE especially in July and August.\r\n\nTrail Description: This especially scenic section of trail crosses the Tellico River on a cement bridge at mile 152.0 (WP 58).

The Skyway is a mountain scenic byway connecting Tellico Plains TN with Robbinsville NC. At the time of its construction, this 40+ mile long route was one of the most expensive highways ever built in the US and took over 20 years to complete. It is a stunningly beautiful mountain highway with incredible views around every bend. Many motorcycles travel this road just for the sheer joy of  experiencing the curves and views.\r\n\nTrail Description: Leave Whigg Meadow (mile 159.4, WP 62) off the north end of the bald, passing below the crest of Haw Knob (5470 foot elevation, highest point in the area) and descending to Mud Gap at mile 161.0 (WP 71). There is a parking lot here for 5 or 6 cars along the edge of the Skyway. Turn left behind the parking lot interpretive sign. The trail soon passes the grave of a soldier killed during the Civil War by the Kirkland Bushwackers. These \u201cbushwackers\u201d were a local family group who took it upon themselves to kill deserters.

At mile 85.0 (WP 94, 3290\u2019), the Big Frog Trail goes left down the west slope of the ridge.  The BMT continues straight onto the Fork Ridge Trail. Remember, this is a Wilderness area so there are no blazes and few signs. The BMT generally follows the ridgeline until it comes to a T-intersection with the Rough Creek Trail at mile 86.8 (WP 95, 2260\u2019). The trail turns left and continues  down the west slope of the ridge to the West Fork of Rough Creek at mile 87.3 (WP 96). It turns right onto the West Fork Trail after crossing the creek. Follow the BMT along the creek downstream. At mile 88.7 the trail leaves the creek (1657\u2019) and heads up a side branch to the left to slowly ascend to FS 221 at mile 89.6 (WP 97, 1900\u2019). Straight across FS 221 is a trailhead for the Tanasi Mountain Bike Trail System.\r\n\nCampsites: Several good campsites are along this section. The most spectacular is on Big Frog (WP 93). There are also a couple campsites without water along the ridgeline between the two humps of Big Frog. There are several possible LNT campsites along the edge of the West Fork of Rough Creek.\r\n\nWater Sources: Water is intermittently available near the campsite on Big Frog (A). Also water can be found 0.2 miles down the Big Frog Trail after it leaves the BMT at the Fork Ridge Intersection. The water is down slope to the right near a big oak with an indistinct trail leading to the source (WP 98, A). Water is also available 0.7 miles down the Fork Ridge Trail at mile 85.7 down the west slope following an indistinct unmarked trail (WP 99, A). Once  reaching Rough Creek and its tributaries, water is plentiful in several spots (A).", "features": "Commonly Backpacked \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildflowers", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7072145/view-at-the-top-of-big-frog-mountain-during-summer", "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 6.6, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [4211, 1710], "alt-change": [265, 2558], "avg-grade": 8.0, "max-grade": 27.0}},

The JMT is named in honor of John Muir's Thousand-Mile Walk to the Gulf (see references), that he took in 1867, one of his first wilderness treks.  On September 19, 1867 he wrote, \"My path today led me along the leafy banks of the Hiwassee, a most impressive mountain river\". The JMT parallels the Hiwassee River, downstream from the Apalachia Powerhouse. Water from the Powerhouse has traveled in a pipeline for over 8 miles from Apalachia Dam, near Farner, TN. Above the powerhouse the river is called the \"Dry Gorge\" as the river bed is a series of scattered pools, separated by areas of \"boulder gardens' and/or heavy vegetation.  A section known as The Narrows, a deep narrow canyon, exposes fascinating rock formations. At high water levels this situation can change drastically, resulting in a roaring whitewater river. The river below the powerhouse is popular with canoers, kayakers, and fly fishermen.\r\n\nTrail Description: From the JMT Childers Creek Trailhead (mile 110.6, WP 16), cross the creek on a wooden bridge and follow the JMT along the north edge of the Hiwassee River close to water level below a steep ridge with many rocky outcrops.  At mile 113.6, pass through the Big Bend Picnic Area and soon cross the paved road and climb up the side of the ridge to a high point at mile 114.5. Descend to the Towee Creek Launch Site at mile 114.8 (WP 21). \r\n\nCampsites: Camping is available at Hiwassee Outfitters (WP 17). There are three primitive campsites between the Childers Creek Trailhead and the Big Bend Picnic Area (WP 22, WP 23, WP 24). Use LNT practices. No camping is allowed in the Big Bend Picnic Area or anywhere within a 1/4 mile of the road along the river, but pit toilets are available at the Big Bend and the Towee Creek Trailheads. Hiwassee Whitewater Co./Flip Flop Burgers has tent sites, bunk house, showers and food.\r\n\nWater Sources:  Water is readily available from the Hiwassee River, Childers Creek (WP 16, D) and Towee Creek (WP 21, D) but must be sterilized. Beware: there are some farms upstream on Childers and Towee Creeks.

This is where the  trail goes through an interesting obstacle course over and under fallen rocks within a series of rock houses.  \r\n\nThe Hidden Passage trail has 3 interesting drop off trails.  Once through the hidden passage, the hiker will come to the first of these trails.  It leads to a beautiful and serene falls called Crystal Falls.  The falls are less than 300 feet from the trail and anyone taking this trail should allow themselves this short side trip.  The other two, Double Falls and Tunnel, will each add a mile or more to the total outing distance.  Heading out to Double Falls will require a creek crossing and going into the Tunnel will require you to have lighting.  Both are worthwhile, if time permits.\r\n\nShortly after the Crystal Falls trail junction the trail climbs to the top of a bluff where it stays for some distance.  The trail is close to the edge which gives some very nice vistas.  The trail then passes under power lines and enters into a part of the woods that have been impacted by the pine beetle and by fire.  From this point and for the next 3 1/2 miles, there will be no cover and very little shade.  This is the same for most of the area east of the power lines.  Plenty of water is recommended.  Water is available from creeks in the area but should be filtered and/or purified.  Thompson's Overlook is located at the eastern edge of this section.  It provides a great vista of the Pickett State Forest.  The side trails to Double Falls and The Tunnel are also in this section.\r\n\nFollow the trail until you are once again west of the power lines.  There, the trail again travels through lush woodlands.  It skirts the Park's Group Camping area and makes its way back to close out the Hidden Passage loop and returns to the trailhead parking area.", "features": "Cave \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Waterfall \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7055810/sandstone-rockcastle-conglomerate-cavity-commonly-known-as-a-cumberland-plateau-", "ratings": {"rating": 4.5, "num_reviewers": 10}, "stats": {"dist": 7.4, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [1680, 1458], "alt-change": [717, 730], "avg-grade": 4.0, "max-grade": 18.0}},

Exiting the paved parking area complete with restrooms (closed in the off-season) the trail is clearly marked. There is a brochure box with a Blevins Loop Guide available should you like to make a 3.6 mile loop out of the trail. The guide has numbered points of interest that correspond to numbered posts along the trail. The loop uses the Oscar Blevins Trail as a return route. \r\n\nTaking the Blevins Trail you'll parallel the road for a short distance before dropping into a more secluded mixed hardwood/pine/hemlock forest. The damage from the Woolly Adelgid, and probably some from the Pine Bark Beetle, is ever present on this trail. Some very grand old trees have been absolutely destroyed and are in an advanced process of decay. Many young trees have sprung up in their place and are competing for the light let through the canopy by the hole left from these massive trees' demise. In fact, the loss of these trees has opened up this area of woodland to a much greater variety of life than would have been present before. Large stretches of a huge variety of moss, a potpourri of saplings and scrub, and the few survivors of the infestations are situated side by side repeatedly. There are also stretches of deeply shaded, seemingly unaffected woodland. \r\n\nThe trail emerges from the forest and terminates at the Blevins homestead. Rolling pasture, log buildings, horses, fence rows, and a 1950's Cumberland style house give you a greatly contrasted view as you emerge from the woods. To make a loop from this point simply go left and follow the signs to the campground. There you'll find rock houses and waterfalls, the signature sights for this area, that we're missing from the Blevins Trail. \r\n\nIf high adventure or jaw dropping views are what you are looking for this is not the trail you should choose. If, however, you want a very friendly trail, gentle hike, or find interest in the understated beauty of a forest in renewal; this is a nice choice.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "All Clear"}, "ratings": {"rating": 3.3, "num_reviewers": 3}, "stats": {"dist": 2.2, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [1635, 1432], "alt-change": [162, 306], "avg-grade": 4.0, "max-grade": 11.0}},

Starting from the Twin Arches trailhead, a wide trail descends into the forest with a mostly sandstone base and a few easy steps.  After about a quarter mile, you'll reach a fork in the trail.  The description assumes you take the right fork, but you can go either direction.  \r\n\nJust after the fork, you'll descend a narrow, steep staircase with about 20 stairs.  It becomes apparent that you're walking along the ridgeline, and you can see sandstone bluffs through the trees across the valley formed by Charit Creek.  A short distance later, you'll notice that there is a steep drop off on both sides of the trail.  At this point, you are standing on top of the south arch, although it isn't obvious because the arch is about 20 feet wide at the top and relatively flat.  Trees obscure the view, but if you venture near the edge, you can see the return trail below.\r\n\nBetween the south and north arches, another steep staircase (about 70 steep, narrow stairs) descends down to the base of the arches.  If you turn around at the bottom of the stairs to face the arches, North Arch is on the left and South Arch on the right.  North Arch spans 93 feet and has a height of 62 feet with a 51 foot clearance.  South Arch is larger with a span of 135 feet,  a height of 103 feet with a 70 foot clearance.  Large boulders present at the bottom give evidence of the erosion/collapse process that lead to the formation of the arches.  The openings are so large it is good to get a good view of them through the trees, but you can walk beneath both arches to get a better idea of the scale.\r\n\nFrom the arches, you can follow the signs back to the parking lot or continue on to the Charit Creek Lodge or \"Jake's Place\" via the Twin Arches Loop Trail.  Charit Creek Lodge is a backcountry lodge accessible only by foot, bike, or horse; Jake's place is an old homestead site.  \r\n\nThe return trip to the parking lot features a couple of impressive rock shelters carved into the same sandstone bluff that forms the arch.  There are a couple of sets of steep steps (about 25 steps each) to ascend with similar narrow treads to the ones you descended earlier on the way out.  Just after the 2nd set of steps, you reach the branch point.

The middle portion of the hike has a relative lack of water sources.\r\n\nThe parking for Leatherwood Ford is located adjacent to where TN-297 crosses over the Cumberland River (about two miles from the \"Entering Big South Fork\" sign to the east, and about three miles from Bandy Creek Visitor Center to the west). From the left side of the parking lot, find the well-signed trailhead.\r\n\nThe trail begins by crossing to the opposite bank of the river. Travel predominately northeast for about a mile, keeping the river below and to the right. Eventually, a fork in the trail offers a choice to go on a brief but steep descent (right) towards a wet crossing and a backcountry campsite, or uphill (left) to continue the JMT Leatherwood Ford.\r\n\nThe left fork begins a .9 mile upward hike which is the most vigorous uphill section of this trail, but also perhaps its most interesting-looking area as well. Switchbacks, large rock overhangs, and mossy trees lie ahead.\r\n\nAfter heading upward and over a downed tree or two, the trail reaches a 4-5 foot vertical obstacle with sandy, poor footing. Some small tree roots on top can be used to steady yourself and assist with overcoming the obstacle, but take care to treat them gently so that future hikers can use them too.\r\n\nPast the obstacle, continue to follow the trail upwards, including some switchbacks and stone steps. After a while the trail will come to a level section, and shortly on the right you'll notice the first of two rock overhangs. The first one features a fire ring and coverage to wait out some bad weather. The second overhang, immediately after, is nice as a lunch spot. A trickle waterfall just ahead vents a refreshing blast of cool air toward the trail on a hot day.\r\n\nAfter the twin overhangs and the little waterfall, a short uphill trail portion leads to a drop-off on top of the previous overhang that must be traversed. The way forward is not perilous in good weather, but cables have been installed for a stabilizing hand hold that may be helpful if the rock is slippery. Shortly after the cables, the trail approaches another 4-5 foot vertical obstacle, but this one features a strong and well-made log ladder on the left side. Clamber up some big log steps before reaching a \"T\" junction with the Grand Gap Loop.\r\n\nThe right path leads to the bulk of the Grand Gap Loop and is not far from the beautiful, panoramic Angel Falls Overlook.

Water is released from the three dams on a schedule for recreation, especially during the summer months and the area can be very crowded and busy. Views of the Ocoee River Gorge can be seen as one climbs up Dry Pond Lead. Much of this section of trail passes through the Little Frog Wilderness and Little Frog Addition Wilderness Study Area and thus there are no diamond blazes and the trail must be maintained with primitive tools such as crosscut and axe.\r\n\nTrail Description: Starting from the Thunder Rock CG overflow lot (WP 1, mile 92.0), hike out the entrance road and over the Ocoee River bridge. Carefully cross US 64 and head up the BMT/Drypond Lead Trail #76. Eventually you'll enter wilderness and will lose the white diamond blazes. At mile 94.2, pass the Rock Creek Trail intersection (WP 4) coming in from the east. This trail follows Rock Creek for 5.4 miles back to US64. At mile 96.3, the Drypond Lead Trail (WP 5) goes straight and soon intersects with Kimsey Mountain Highway (0.4 miles) but the BMT turns left. This can be a confusing and easy to miss trail intersection. The left turn is just past the wilderness sign. At mile 97.6 the BMT crosses under power lines at Deep Gap (WP 2), the first access to Kimsey Mountain Highway. The trail continues however, to mile 99.0 (WP 3), where it crosses Kimsey Mountain Highway. Part of this section is in wilderness, so blazes are not ever-present.\r\n\nCampsites: The Thunder Rock Campground at mile 92.0 (WP 1), is a USFS class A/B campground with 41 sites, potable water, flush toilets, and showers in season. As this CG is popular with kayakers and rafters in the summer months sites may be difficult to find. There are no other primitive designated campsites on this stretch of trail, though sites can be found using LNT ethics.\r\n\nWater Sources: Potable water is available at the Thunder Rock Campground and at the Ocoee Whitewater Center, accessed via the Rhododendron Trail #335 (see map).

Also at this location is the Thunder Rock Campground with hot showers in season. About a mile and a half east on US64 is the Ocoee Whitewater Center, location of the 1996 Whitewater Summer Olympics. The Whitewater Center is best reached by hiking the Rhododendron Trail, connected to the BMT on the south side of the river by the bridge. The center has a visitor center, picnic area, gift shop, restrooms, and minimal snacks. Seven and a half miles to the east on US 64 is Ducktown, a small town which was the site of huge open pit copper mines. The area was deforested by the sulfuric acid fumes, but has made a remarkable recovery. Restaurants, grocery stores, motels, and the Ducktown Basin Museum are highlights of this village. Parts of the Old Copper Road are now a hiking/biking trail which parallels the river between Ducktown and Cleveland. This road was the primary transport for smelted copper out of the Copper Basin prior to the coming of the railroad.\r\n\nTrail Description: After crossing FS 221 at mile 89.6 (WP 97, 1900\u2019), the BMT turns left and goes down the gated forest road following the white diamonds. About 0.3 miles down this road, the trail takes a sharp left onto another road and follows the old roadbed through a large area of old growth hemlocks to mile 91.3 where the BMT crosses FS 45. From here the trail climbs the bank and then works its way up along a ridgeline, then descends steeply down a series of steps and switchbacks to the Ocoee River and the west end of the Thunder Rock Campground and follows the campground road out through the campground entrance at mile 92.7 (WP 100, 1120\u2019) passing by the shower house and restrooms, then out to FS 45. To continue on the BMT, turn left, hike past the powerhouse (Rhododendron Trail goes right just before the bridge), and cross the Ocoee River on the bridge. From here the BMT crosses this very busy multi-lane highway at mile 93.0 and heads up the mountainside on the south side of the highway.\r\n\nCampsites: The preferred campsite in this section is the USFS campground at the Ocoee River (Thunder Rock Campground, WP 100), which has 41 class A/B campsites, potable water, restrooms and a shower house (open in season). The campground is generally closed in the winter except for a few campsites next to the parking lot, but check the Cherokee National Forest website or call the Ocoee Whitewater Center for dates of operation and for when the showers are available. \r\n\nWater Sources: There is potable water available at the Thunder Rock Campground. Also water is available between FS 221 and FS 45 at a bend in the old roadbed in a draw at mile 90.3 (C) and on the section between FS 45 and Thunder Rock Campground at a small stream crossing at mile 92.4 (A).", "features": "Commonly Backpacked \u00b7 River/Creek", "condition": "Unknown"}, "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 3.2, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [1905, 1142], "alt-change": [149, 899], "avg-grade": 6.0, "max-grade": 29.0}},

The difficulty comes in various forms ranging from abrupt trail turns to traversing stone/rock paths which, when snow-covered and icy, can be quite tricky, so taking it slow in these areas is key. Another thing that can be tricky in this first section of the hike is the trail markers. They are there, just not as frequent and exposed as other parts of the trail. You can easily go in the wrong direction in one or two areas if you are not paying attention.\r\n\nOnce you get to Collins River, you are getting ready to climb up the trail to the Rim portion. You do have to cross Collins River, but there are good bridges to use although no more than two people should go at a time when crossing. The first bridge crossing does have some nice views of the river. After you cross the river for the last time, you'll begin your hike up to the Rim. You gain some elevation here, but the climb is pretty gradual. Take your time, and it won't be that strenuous. \r\n\nOnce you are actually on the Rim, the rest of the trail is pretty smooth. There will be some climbs and descents, none of which are very hard. You'll cross several streams; depending on time of year and amount of rainfall, they may be hard to cross without getting wet. And if the temps are below freezing, they can prove quite tricky to cross. In other words, don't rush. \r\n\nThere are several beautiful lookout points along the way as well. The access trails to these points are marked with blue markers. This portion of the trail is very nice and quite serene, but at times does seem never ending. Have faith and keep hiking, and you'll come to the end of the Collins Rim Trail. The actually rim portion of the trail is around 4.5 miles. The Collins Rim Trail will run into two different trails. One is Stagecoach Road Historic Trail leading you to the Connector Trail which from there you can go west to towards Stone Door or you can go east towards Hobbs cabin.\r\n\nThis trail overall is amazing, full of challenges and adventure.", "features": "Commonly Backpacked \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Views", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7043967/one-of-the-beautiful-overlooks-on-collins-rim-trail", "ratings": {"rating": 4.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 5.9, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [1922, 1694], "alt-change": [851, 796], "avg-grade": 5.0, "max-grade": 40.0}},

They are easily marked and easily traveled. Around half a mile in, you come to a short spur trail leading to Schwoon Spring; here you can get more water. The trail leading to the spring isn't difficult but it does climb the entire way. This was a nice stopping point for lunch. The next 2 miles are fairly average and easy. Along the way here, you'll pass Fall Creek Sink and Horsepound Falls, both of which make for beautiful sights.\r\n\nJust after passing Horsepound Falls, you basically begin your ascent for the last mile or so before reaching the end of the trail that connects you to the Collins West Camp Access Trail. This last portion of the hike can prove quite challenging. There are several switchbacks that climb pretty quickly. There is some rocky terrain next which is fun to cross; if these areas are wet or icy, it can be quite dangerous. Along this portion, the trail is very narrow at times, so be mindful not to take a wrong step (it is a long way down). \r\n\nAt the very end of this trail (or beginning from Collins West Camp Access Trail), you'll pass Suter Falls.

I traveled from Rooster Front Park toward Steele Creek Park. The trailhead is difficult to find in the summer, but easily spotted in fall/winter. \r\n\nCross the bridge on the left at the map sign. It is the trail on your right that immediately begins ascending (note: as this trail begins, it goes to the left or straight up). Go straight up for the Lake Ridge Trail. Soon there will be another left turn. Stay straight. The trail will climb and level off at intervals to the top and then go down and level off at intervals on the way back down. There are several switchbacks.  \r\n\nThe trail is wide enough to hike single file and on the ridge near the creek and lake it is very narrow. I have a fear of heights, and there were two stretches of narrow trail I had to take a deep breath and just focus on getting through it, but I was hiking on completely leaf covered trail the entire way and I may not have felt so insecure at these points had it been in the summer on dirt. Even though the trail is leaf covered, I could tell it was primarily dirt with roots here and there and some rocks here and there but nothing major. I was able to step around or over any muddy spots.  \r\n\nThere are 3 bridges and no creek hopping. Blazes on the Steele Creek Park side of the ridge are fresh but on the Rooster Front Park side are fading (as of Nov 2018) but detectable. The 454 ft lake overlook side trail on the Steele Creek Park side was a bust. Even in November with the leaves mostly gone the view was very obstructed.

There are some rolling hills as you mostly follow the stream, but nothing too obnoxious (that comes later). It's a genuinely enjoyable hike with numerous places to stop and enjoy the scenery. At the far northwest end you exit the woods and onto what appears to be a resort-type property, called Big East Fork Retreat. There are what appear to be stables and a really neat looking concrete dome (which I have seen called a \"hogan\") that looks very appropriate for, oh, I don't know, painting or crafts, or even semi-rugged camping. The walls along two sides are made from colored bottles set in the concrete and I would imagine it's very pretty inside on a sunny day.\r\n\nNearby is a pretty, apparently spring-fed lake bordered by several benches, making it very attractive for picnickers. At this point the trail bends back to the southeast, bordering the forest for about a quarter mile before plunging back in to the woods. Depending on the recent weather it may be a bit mucky here but take heart, it doesn't last long. The path remains wide and pleasant and slopes generally up hill, past an attractive spring and a disused shack, and it's a real joy until the last, where it starts to climb back up the ridge.

Continue along the roadbed as the forest opens up and animal signs becomes more common. The now overgrown road is covered in a mix of dog hobble, briars, and wildflowers. The trail crosses the upper section of Falls Creek Branch and the big metal pipe around 1.75 miles in. The trail intersects with Falls Branch Falls Trail #87 just below the southern trailhead, and typical access, at West Rattlesnake Rock along the Cherohala Skyway.\r\n\nIn local lore, the area came by its name tragically. A man named Jeffrey supposedly lost his hunting dogs during a wildfire and went to find them, even if he had to go to hell to do it.

This trail and area is a state natural area that is managed by the wonderful people of Pickett State Park. Take the time to look at the kiosk for the great information provided. \r\n\nFirstly, the trail is easily accessible and very well kept. Frequented by the locals, it is a wonderful place for a short jaunt in nature. The trail from the parking area takes you into beautiful shaded hemlock stands and to the edge of the cove. From this point, you can overlook the cove area and get the first glimpse of some hundreds of year old trees as well as the waterfall and the rock house. Follow the trail around to your right, continuing on through hemlocks, you'll cross a small bridge over a creek. Look to your left while on the bridge, and you'll see where the water flows over the rock, which will have created the beautiful waterfall that you'll hike under once down in the cove. \r\n\nFollow the trail around to the left after crossing the small bridge and continue hiking through the hemlock stand. You'll note some of the hemlocks have blue dots on them. This dot represents that the tree was treated for an invasive adelgid that is killing off the eastern hemlock. The Hemlock Woolly Adelgid Strike Team for the State of Tennessee Division of Forestry is traveling around the Cumberland Plateau trying to save this species from extinction. \r\n\nThere will be a sharp turn to your left that will take you under the bluff and towards the waterfall and rock house. You'll start to see the larger and older hemlock trees down in this area. \r\n\nFollow the trail under the waterfall and back into and around the rock house, it will then take you back up the bluff and loop around to the trail that will take you back to the parking area.

The trail is mostly singletrack now but it follows a (very) old rail bed very close to the banks of the Conasauga River. It's a very pretty hike and a number of trails lead down to swimming or wading areas in the river.  \r\n\nWhile the trail is pretty flat, except for a couple of the creek crossings, enough roots and rocks have made their way back into the railbed that this is definitely not a rail trail. The singletrack is pretty wide at the beginning as it's used for access to the cool Conasauga River, and you'll find a good number of people there on a hot summer day. As you get further from the trailhead, the singletrack can become pretty narrow through the vegetation.\r\n\nThere are half a dozen or so small to medium creek crossings, so plan on getting a little wet. Some of these get messy as the trail sees some horse traffic. A few rocks in the trail as well as a couple of creek crossings keep it from meriting an easy rating. Particularly towards end, you'll have some impressive rock walls to your left.

An especially beautiful view can be seen from the swinging bridge which crosses the river at the Apalachia Powerhouse. Another notable feature is the section known as The Narrows, a deep narrow gorge through which the old river bed flows. The confluence of Coker Creek with the Hiwassee River has also created an interesting array of large, beautifully shaped boulders, but descent to the stream from the BMT is challenging. A side trip 3 miles up the Coker Creek Trail #183 will lead to a beautiful series of cascades and waterfalls.\r\n\nTrail Description: The old JMT route followed the river edge upstream from the Towee Creek TH past the Apalachia Powerhouse and under the swinging bridge. This section of trail was rerouted to avoid the busy road and the dangerous riverside trail, but a nice 5-mile loop can be made combining the old and new routes. From the Towee Creek overflow parking lot at mile 114.2, head east along the edge of Towee Creek, then cross the creek at a shallow ford at mile 114.8. In high water, this crossing can be challenging and a reroute is under construction (noted in green) to avoid the bridge. The newest reroute will cross the road bridge over Towee Creek, then turn off the north side of the road ascending the ridgeline through a series of switchbacks to intersect the old route at the ridgeline. For the current route, ford the creek and head up to the top of the ridge on a couple of switchbacks, then follow the ridgeline trail, eventually descending to intersect with the old JMT at mile 117.1. Turn left and cross Rock Island Branch, then Wildcat Creek at mile 117.4. Cross Loss Creek at 119.3 (with care!) and come to FR 22B and Coker Creek at mile 120.5. The Coker Creek Trail #183 also leaves from the campsites and goes three miles upstream to Coker Creek Falls, a beautiful series of cascades and waterfalls.\r\n\nCampsites: At FS 22B by the edge of Coker Creek (WP 25), there are a few primitive campsites without toilets. Several other primitive LNT campsites are found along the route, especially where the trail crosses Loss Creek on the west side of the crossing (WP 28).\r\n\nWater Sources: Water which must be sterilized can be obtained from the Hiwassee River, Towee Creek (WP 21, D), Rock Island Branch (WP 26, B), Wildcat Creek (WP 27, D), Loss Creek (WP 28, D), and Coker Creek (WP 25, D).", "features": "Commonly Backpacked \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Views", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7069342/plugitinhikes-overlooking-the-narrows-on-the-hiwassee-river", "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 5.8, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [1490, 855], "alt-change": [1154, 968], "avg-grade": 7.0, "max-grade": 21.0}},

After crossing the creek, the trail turns right and heads up the edge of the ridge along the creek, crossing over a gap and intersecting with the Unicoi Mountain Trail at mile 120.9 (WP 30). Turn left up the Unicoi Mountain Trail and ascend gently to moderately up the ridge to the top of the mountain at mile 122.7 to a somewhat flat area.

Most of this section of trail is a designated motorcycle trail. Buck Bald is up the Buck Bald Road FR 198 0.7 miles from the trail and has a 360 degree view of the surrounding mountains. A side trip up FR198 is well worth the effort even though it is a 1.4 mile round trip. Unicoi Gap is near the TN/NC state line and is a site on the historic Unicoi Turnpike National Historic Trail, which intersects the BMT just south of Unicoi Gap. This trail, which spanned the Cherokee Nation, reached from near Savannah to the Little Tennessee River. It is said to have been in use for over 1,000 years. It was called the Tellico Path, the Overhill Trading Path, and the Great Trading Path. In 1812, it became a 12 foot wagon road called the Unicoi Turnpike with a tollgate at Unicoi Gap. After the Cherokee Removal it became known as a part of the Trail of Tears. Much of it is now the Joe Brown Highway, a mostly unpaved road that leads to Murphy, NC. Interpretative signs are now present at the gap which is a trailhead for the Unicoi Motorcycle Trail #82, the BMT, and the Unicoi Turnpike Trail. \r\n\nTrail Description: From TN 68 at mile 124.5 (WP 31), the trail heads up the side of the mountain, reaching the top at the intersection with the Unicoi Motorcycle Trail #82 at mile 125.0 (WP 34). The trail crosses Buck Bald Road FR113 at mile 125.6, then skirts along the edge of Buck Bald and continues up the ridgeline to Unicoi Gap at mile 129.2 (WP 33). On the motorcycle trail section, move off the trail if you hear motorcycles coming.\r\n\nCampsites: No designated campsites are present along this section, though LNT primitive sites can be found, but without available water.\r\n\nWater Sources: The only reliable water sources are a spring along TN 68 (WP 31,  D), 0.2 miles south of the trail crossing, and at Unicoi Gap (WP 32, B), about 0.2 miles down the road to the right (east).", "features": "Commonly Backpacked \u00b7 Views", "condition": "Unknown"}, "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 4.9, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [2202, 1795], "alt-change": [870, 601], "avg-grade": 6.0, "max-grade": 20.0}},

He and his wife moved to the home to get above the \u201cdust level\u201d due to his wife\u2019s asthmatic condition. They lived there for several years before moving back to the town of Tellico Plains. Most of this property was purchased by the USFS in 1973. About 100 acres of this property was awarded by the court to the Monroe County Board of Education, and the USFS has recently procured this tract as well. The building is now just a shell but makes a great place to eat lunch with a spring running right through the old basement. Also, at Six Mile Gap there is a side trail with a half-mile 500 foot elevation climb up to Waucheesi Bald with incredible views and a great camping site, but without water.\r\n\nTrail Description: The trail heads north out of Unicoi Gap (mile 129.2) on a gated forest service road for about a mile where the trail exits right off the road at mile 130.0 and climbs up a ridgeline trail northward. This trail skirts the east side of Peels High Top, then enters Peels Gap at mile 131.5. The trail again leaves the gap along the east side of the ridgeline and crosses over to the west side at an unnamed gap at mile 132.2 (WP 38). There often is water just southeast of this gap as well as at three sites on the west side over the next half mile down from the gap. The trail merges into the Unicoi Mtn Horse Trail #117 at mile 130.0 (WP 39), then follows this horse trail to a mile 132.1 then goes on to Tate Gap and the old Doc Rogers homesite (WP 36) at mile 133.5. The trail follows an old roadbed to the top of the gap, then cuts sharp left (WP 40) straight up the ridgeline towards Cantrell Top and Six Mile Gap (mile 135.5). At Six Mile Gap (WP 41) there is a trail which cuts left up to Waucheesi Bald for about 0.45 miles, a worthwhile side trip and a great spot to camp, but without water. From Six Mile Gap, the trail turns east and descends to Sandy Gap at mile 137.6 (WP 35). Since the BMT traverses wilderness from Six Mile to Sandy Gap, there are no trail blazes on this section but there are a few signs. The Kirkland Creek Trail (#85) heads north at Sandy Gap down to the Bald River Road 6.7 miles away. \r\n\nCampsites: Primitive LNT campsites can be had at most any flat space along the trail. There are no developed campsites. A great LNT campsite is at Waucheesi Bald (WP 42). Another nice campsite is just east of the BMT at Tate Gap. Continue on the old road through the gap rather than turning left up the ridgeline.
