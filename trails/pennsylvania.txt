Slightly harder to identify at the western terminus, the trail spurs off from the GRT/NCT without any significant signage.  Possibly the easiest way to remember that the trail splits is by using Lake Arthur as the marker. Nowhere else on the GRT/NCT does the trail get so close to Lake Arthur. So, keep this in mind. You'll descend what will seem like the 4th or 5th significant hill, and arrive at Lake Arthur, but the trail will turn and head up a hill within 2 minutes (.1 mile) after reaching the lake. This is where the trail splits, and if you stay along the banks of Lake Arthur, you'll have linked into this alternate route.\r\n\nThis alternate is really nice, providing a change of pace and scenery for the first half of the trail.

As it follows the boardwalk it zigzags over a shallow marsh. While it is bowed and in need of small repairs, it is a nice place to hike. Here is an opportunity to view the various wildlife alive in the lake including salamanders and small fish.  \r\n\nAfter leaving the boardwalk, the trail transitions into a nice dirt path along the lake. When I did this trail, as we made this transition a bald eagle leaped from the branches above us and soared over the lake.  As it continues, there is a pine grove where the path widens to include a small group of rock formations. As the trail curves at the north end of the lake, it passes rocks that have been laid out to spell \"Parker Dam\" on the ground.\r\n\nThe trail then continues over the berm of the mostly earthen, CCC-era dam. To the right, just in the lake is a structure that supports a bat box.  Next, the trail comes to the part of the dam over which Laurel Run flows. This part of the dam is fairly ingenious as instead of a traditional bridge, a large area of steppingstones has been placed to accommodate for the movement of both visitors and the stream. The trail crosses these stones and climbs up stairs on the other side of the dam.\r\n\nAfter the dam, the trail ventures into a more wooded section of the park.  This is the first time where the yellow blazes that mark the trail are both visible and necessary. The rest of the trail continues fairly flat and near the river, though there are some places that are overgrown and muddy.  This is a generally pleasant second half of the trail.

The trail here is rocky but gently graded as it begins to climb to the upper north branch of Water Tank Run. The trail will then cross the gravel Clay Mine Rd (a dirt parking is located 100 yds north of the trail crossing for those seeking a resupply).

The trail can be done as one larger 50 mile loop or use the East Branch trail to create a 31 mile or 24 mile option. Starting from the main parking area on Rt. 144, across from swamp branch rd., hike the trail in a counterclockwise direction.  \r\n\nThe first couple of miles start off pretty mellow before dropping down into the first big decent into the Fish Dam Wild Area.  Hike to the stream and then climb out via a short, steep climb.  Next you'll drop down into the Burns Run Wild Area.  This is a long decent to the stream with a long and steep ascent out of the wild area.  Next, the trail leads to the Yost Run area.  It is a long, gradual ascent out of Yost Run.  You'll be rewarded with a series of waterfalls toward the end of Yost Run.  Cross Rt. 144 at an alternate trailhead parking area and then begin a decent into the Eddy Lick area.  You'll meander along Eddy Lick and come across several remnants of the old logging era.  \r\n\nAfter Eddy Lick enjoy a long stretch of  moderate terrain that mostly follows old logging roads.  At approximately mile 28 the Chuck Keiper intersects the East Branch Trail.  You can take this trail to cut the larger loop in half.  Continue hiking the rolling terrain to the Cranberry Swamp area.  Take the loop around Cranberry Swamp or bypass if you want to cut some mileage.  Next head into a smaller drainage with a moderate climb to Mill Run Rd.  After crossing Mill Run, drop into the steeper Boggs Run area. Hike along Boggs Run for sever miles before climbing out and coming to a vista once you cross Peters Run Rd.  \r\n\nNext drop into another drainage and cross Rt. 144 again.  Descend into the final drainage of the hike and follow the stream for a while before climbing out to join Barneys Ridge Rd.  Take a short side trip to Big Rocks Vista.  After a little road hiking, veer to the right and back to the parking lot. Finish with the great vista from the parking lot.

The easiest access point to this 4.7 mile section is from the southern terminus. There is parking on the north side of the road, just after turning past Snowy Mountain Rd, while staying on 233. Look for a sign on the north side of the road (about 200 after right turn) with directions to the AT and Raccoon Run Trail. The trees are marked with blue blazes. \r\n\nThe trail begins with a slightly rocky start before crossing over to the east side of 233, where it remains for this entire section. After crossing 233, expect another crossing over the Rocky Mountain Creek. The bridge is in good condition and did not show any signs of aging. A quick left turn after the bridge, and you'll begin the main leg of the trail moving northward, following 233. \r\n\nThe trail has some slight gains and losses of elevation with nothing more than 3-5% for the first few miles. This is a great warm up section if you plan on hiking the length of the trail and back. We did this trail on February 13 and conditions here were sometimes not ideal. Certain areas were a little flooded (no higher than the ankle) due to snowmelt. \r\n\nAfter crossing one logging road, a second road crossing is needed. The trail picks up on other corner of the bridge. The last mile of the trail was the most difficult. There can be icy conditions due to being on the shaded side of the mountain among lots of evergreen trees.

At this point, there are several discontinuous sections available.  This section of the trail is from Conshohocken to Parkersford.  For most of the path, this is paved and 4-8 feet wide.  It typically follows the river, although at times it may track straighter than the river and stray from the river's edge.\r\n\nThis section begins in a commercial/industrial section of Conshohocken.  At the start there is easy access to food, beverage and parking.  Just downriver on the trail (to be mapped still), there is a brewery with trail access.\r\n\nGoing upstream from Conoshohocken, you'll pass a blend of urban suburban, and rural landscapes.  The trail will travel through the edge of Norristown, before entering into Valley Forge National Historical Park (A connector to the park is still under construction, although a temporary wooden walkway is available along the US 422 bridge at Betzwoood Access).\r\n\nIn Valley Forge, the trail is wooded.  If it weren't for paralleling US 422, it would be quiet and serene.  After the trail crosses the Perkiomen Creek, one switchback carries the trail down to stream level near the Confluence of the Perkiomen Creek and Schuylkill River.  The trail continues along the bank of the Schuylkill behind an Industrial area of Oaks before another wooded and  isolated stretch up to Reynold's dog park.\r\n\nAt the Dog Park and downriver end of the Schuylkill Canal, the trail takes a hard S turn around the end of the Schuylkill Canal and continues on the riverside/towpath of the Canal (to be more accurate, it's really a navigation, not a canal).  From here until the Route 29 bridge in Phoenixville the trail is mostly grass/crushed stone.  (There is an onroad option of the trail at this point)\r\n\nAt the Route 29 Bridge, the trail crosses the Schuylkill into Chester County, then follows a few road sections behind Bridge Street (filled with popular shopping and dining options).  A recently opened section of trail continues through the gentle slopes and rural areas of Chester County to the trailhead in Parkersford.

Look for a sign post for Astronomy Trail to the right of the grassy area. There are occasional red blazes. \r\n\nFrom here, the trail remains fairly level on hard packed soil, passing through open woodland with acres of blueberry bushes and mountain laurel. The trail becomes narrow in places from the overgrowth. At 1.5-miles, the trail begin a rocky descent to Milesburn Road within sight of Baltimore Rd.

It travels over I-376 and the Fort Duquesne Tunnels and around to the West End. It finishes on the top of Mount Washington with a view of the entire city including both Heinz Field, PNC Park and historic Fort Duquesne Park. For most of this you'll forget you are in a major metropolitan area. This is really a hidden gem of a trail.\r\n\nStarting at Olympia Park. Head down Hallock Street to the dead end and the trailhead. The trail is pretty well maintained singletrack. \r\n\nAt the first intersection take a right. This will keep you on the Emerald View Trail. If you go left, you'll add about a 1/2 mile or so on a loop connector. No big deal as you'll get back on Emerald View very soon. \r\n\nAt roughly 600 meters you are going to go up a short incline and come out on a street. Don't be alarmed. This is Sweetbriar Street. You'll be on this for about 100 meters. Take a left back onto the trail. It is marked with a trail marker. FYI, occasionally there are some dogs out on this street. The owner is usually around, he is pretty nice, but the dogs seem to be less than super friendly.\r\n\nOnce back in the dirt stay on the trail, over I-376. You'll eventually cross over Shaler Street. The trail is directly across from you. This is the first of the inclines that will eventually get you to the top. Pay attention to the trail markers and  you'll be fine. For the most part stay to the left and you'll be fine! \r\n\nOnce across Shaler Street you'll start to turn towards Pittsburgh and will be able to see the West End.  \r\n\nThe next slightly tricky part is when you cross Greenleaf Street. Make sure you head up the road in front of you to what looks like a driveway with some cones at the top. The trail goes that way! Once you get past the old camp trailer go straight past the gravel driveway and to the trail that loops to the right. You'll go up for a bit and come to the last intersection. Stay to the LEFT. You do not want to get on the Expedition Trail. From this intersection stay on the path for about a kilometer. This should take you to the top for a great view of the city! \r\n\nIf you want to hike back down (super fun!), just reverse path. Comes out to about 9k for the round trip. \r\n\nEnjoy!", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 Views", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7062224/sunny-view-of-pittsburgh", "ratings": {"rating": 4.3, "num_reviewers": 3}, "stats": {"dist": 2.9, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [1144, 919], "alt-change": [449, 322], "avg-grade": 5.0, "max-grade": 18.0}},

In less than a half mile, the trail peeks out of the woods at a small cinder pull off before taking a hard right and crossing Squaw Run via large stepping stones.

Dogs are off leash, and hikers should take caution when opening the gate to enter and exit. There are several paths you can take, all of which lead to the back of the park. Shortly after all the paths converge, you'll see a trail marker (concrete or wooden posts with a green circle and white arrow pointing the direction) directing you up a steep climb. While traveling south to north, the trail is always heading uphill; this is by far the biggest climb and toughest section. There is an equally long descent on the other end.  \r\n\nWhen you exit the woods again, you'll see a small concrete block shed and another trail sign (this time brown with yellow print). You'll cross over Squaw Run once again, using large stepping stones. Then hikers will cross the roadway and begin the last section of trail, most of which is doubletrack.\r\n\nThis last section starts out slow, but less than mid-way through the climb begins to Beechwood Farms Nature Reserve.

Local flavors abound at restaurants, bars and grills, creameries, and caf\u00e9s.  Along the trail, overnight accommodations range from lovely bed-and-breakfasts to comfortable guest houses, and from campgrounds to hotels. Outfitters and bike shops have a range of gear available. Travelers enjoy art galleries, stately town squares, boutique museums, renovated train stations, holiday parades, craft breweries, and historical sites. Festivals and celebrations take place throughout the seasons. Once connected by railroads, and now by the trail, our towns are destinations to explore, provide fuel for your journey, and give welcome respite every few miles.   \r\n\nWith a crushed limestone (or in some sections, paved) surface, and a gentle, nearly-flat grade, the Great Allegheny Passage is a perfect path for families.

There are small trees to grasp as you descend, but hikers should take care not to rely too heavily on them as this could potentially damage the trees.

There are three elements to this trail: jaggers, rocks/boulders, runs.  Going counterclockwise, the trail begins with a gentle descent, before turning straight down the mountainside at ~15-20% for a quarter mile, and then easing up again. The beginning section of trail, at roughly 2800 feet, is covered in knee-high grasses, similar to McKenna Trail. As you descend the trail, the grasses thin and vanish, before around 2200 feet, jaggers (briars) appear and thicken. This makes the trail a bit tougher to hike because the jaggers are large enough to cut up your legs. You may note a run crossing that cuts the trail diagonally. You'll cross this run later, when it is much larger and rushing downhill.\r\n\nAround the first mile, the trail takes a significant turn left (south), but there appears to be other options.  Follow the yellow blazes. Very shortly after this turn, the trail makes another hard right, which is miss-able.  Small logs and sticks are dragged across the trail to mark the turn. If you stay straight the trail becomes noticeably less \"maintained\" and you'll not see any yellow blazes.\r\n\nIt is very shortly after these series of turns that you'll come to a brief section with boulders on either side of the trail and look like monuments. It's a nice reprieve from the jaggers and monotony of the trail.  \r\n\nOnce at the bottom of the mountain, the trail slowly begins rising. You'll cross two streams at this point. The first stream you'll have crossed earlier, and has grown as it picks up more water. The other stream originates within the loop. Roaring Run Natural Area contains several natural springs. Note the clarity of the water.\r\n\nThe final big turn marks the start of the 1000 foot climb. Unlike the descent, it is less steep and can be hike in many of the sections.

Descend through wildflower and azalea filled woods to Baldwin Creek (often wet crossing, but gas well driveway just north could be high water passage), pass fence to abandoned Baldwin Creek Road.

Occasional remnants of former farms such as old ponds and fences. Climb to Route 49 to cross Cummings Creek, then follow an abandoned portion of Route 49 through the old location of Nelson village with home shrubs grown wild. Climb briefly again to Route 49 to cross Cowanesque River, with Nelson Falls visible to south crossing on road bridge. (Closer view from side trail across road.) In four more miles of wide mowed path, in part on a railroad bed, reach short-season (mid-May to Sept only) Tompkins Campground and last parking lot.\r\n\nReturn to narrow gravel roads climbing gently to the state line, where orange blazes continue as Crystal Hills Trail, carrying Great Eastern Trail to its northern terminus on the other side of Steuben County, NY.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 Lake \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Swimming \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Waterfall \u00b7 Wildflowers", "condition": "Unknown"}, "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 18.1, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [1811, 1083], "alt-change": [2125, 1680], "avg-grade": 4.0, "max-grade": 31.0}},

This section is privately owned through posted private land. At a former bridge over Raystown Branch Juniata River, veer right on paths that will sometimes veer very close to the river, and check out the old railroad turntable pit on the way. The trail eventually brings you through the moonscape of the Earlston Furnace Cinder Piles, which is complete with dystopian views of Aliquippa Gap. \r\n\nEmerge on the north end of Black Valley Rd (no parking) and cross a road bridge into Everett Borough. Follow the levee along Raystown Branch several blocks, then descend steps to Spring St. Cross the historic Lincoln Highway (W Main St) and pass Sheetz convenience store (grab a bite here if you're hungry). You'll then reach a junction with a bypass (here unblazed) at 3rd and Spring streets. Blazes for now lead uphill on W 3rd St., underneath a US 30 bypass, and then head left onto and old railroad bed. \r\n\nAt the north abutment of missing bridge, edge west on an old road and then follow the shoulder of US 30 proper to Snake Spring Valley Rd. From there, head north to a cattle farm and a long climb through cow pasture and brushy woods to a well earned summit. From the summit, turn left onto a brushy, rocky ridgeline, and pass a junction with the Blue Triangle Trail bypass route. Here you'll experience several rock scrambles and viewpoints. \r\n\nThe only flat spot in this portion is at the Dunkard Path crossing, but keep in mind that there is still no legal camping on intermixed State Game Land, or on private land. Eventually, you'll drop sharply to the left and descend a ridge to reach a Game Land management road. The northern third of this section is relatively easy hiking on management road, even after it narrows and becomes non-drivable. \r\n\nPass a junction of informal and very rough trail to the Loysburg Flag. Then, leave the Game Land and quickly cross the 2013-built fiberglass bridge over Yellow Creek. This handicapped accessible route heads to a small parking area next to PA Route 36. Turn right onto PA 36 when you're in the heart of the gap and the trail will veer off to an old roadbed.

According to the display, the steps were built in the 1930's for miners as they made their way to the Ledge Quarry, a sandstone mine. \r\n\nThe steps start almost immediately and lead up the mountain. The trail is a tough 0.5 miles, but pull-offs are present for the occasional break. The steps are numbered every 100 so progress can be measured; each 100 is a worthy accomplishment! The usual fauna and flora of the area surround the trail, and it is a very enjoyable experience (one may not think so on the way up, but look around on the return trip!). \r\n\nOnce the top step is achieved (step 1037 to be exact), a well-deserved rest is in order. If the quaking legs allow, a right (south) at the top of the steps is the Mount Union View Trail, and a left is the Standing Stone Trail-State Game Land 112 Segment.

Continuing on, there are a few more smaller stream crossings, two steeper climbs, and several opportunities to enjoy a quick departure from the trail to another creek that it's roughly following.\r\n\nAt around 1.25 miles in, the trail turns right and follows the creek upstream. There are some deeper pools along this section of creek that dogs can easily enjoy (think kiddie pool, more wading than swimming). This section can also require some rock hopping to stay dry especially after heavy rains.\r\n\nAfter going up the creek just a few hundred feet, the trail crosses over to the left, and scrambles up some boulders. The trail remains rocky for the next few hundred feet, but keep your eyes open near the end of this for the Sand Spring sign and side trail on the left (about 1.5 miles in). This leads a few dozen feet to the actual spring where water is bubbling up through white sand in many spots into the large pool of water.\r\n\nBack on the main trail, it continues for another half mile before reaching a three side rock walled spring and, to the left, the orange blazed Tom Lowe Trail that can be used to make a 5.25 mile loop.

The orange-blazed Tom Lowe trail will start on the right in a couple hundred feet. The trail follows the creek for a short distance before crossing over. It can be difficult to stay completely dry on this crossing (especially after heavy rain) and it may be better to look up or downstream a bit if you really don't want to get wet feet.\r\n\nAfter crossing, there's a short steep scramble straight up the hillside and then the trail drops more gently back towards the creek farther downstream. After leveling out, the trail can get muddy or wet for a little bit as it runs next to the creek (or flooded out by it).\r\n\nAbout 0.6 miles in, the trail makes a sharp right and then starts climbing up the hillside before traversing across it. This is generally much dryer than the earlier section, but if you pay attention as you're crossing the hillside, you'll cross a rocky section and may be able to hear water gurgling underground through the rocks.\r\n\nThe trail descends off the hillside and comes out on a doubletrack forest road. Turn right on the doubletrack road and follow it for a short distance where it ends in bit of a clearing. The trail continues on straight ahead.\r\n\nThe next section has a few stream crossings in a short distance, followed by some larger blowdown and the trail can be harder to follow. Particularly, the trail makes a 90 degree left turn immediately after a crossing followed by a 90 degree right.\r\n\nThe trail makes another hard right and starts gently climbing uphill as it follows a creek from varying distances.  At some point, there is a small unmarked trail on the right that goes down a steep bank to the creek where there is a wood bench at the foot of a small series of waterfalls/cascades.\r\n\nA simple bridge eventually crosses the creek to the right and then in another quarter mile the trail makes a very steep climb for another quarter mile. At the top, the trail joins with a wider path that was cut for a controlled burn. The original Tom Lowe trail can occasionally be seen running parallel for short distances, but pay attention as you'll need to take the trail when it completely splits from the wide path.\r\n\nThe trail ends at an intersection with the blue blazed Sand Spring Trail which can be taken to the right for a 5.2 mile loop back to the parking lot.", "features": "River/Creek \u00b7 Waterfall", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7057547/foggy-day-along-trail", "ratings": {"rating": 4.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 3.1, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [1545, 830], "alt-change": [924, 356], "avg-grade": 8.0, "max-grade": 28.0}},

Keep in mind that this trail is multi-use so keep an eye out for bikers and even horses.\r\n\nBetween the creek and the horse farms, this rolling trail offers all you could want in a hike -- the sites, the smells and even some solitude.\r\n\nThis does hook up with the Lebanon Valley Rail Trail which can make your hike even longer if you so desire.", "features": "Fall Colors \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "ratings": {"rating": 3.8, "num_reviewers": 6}, "stats": {"dist": 5.1, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [432, 387], "alt-change": [49, 4], "avg-grade": 0.0, "max-grade": 1.0}},

The park service has done a good job this spring (2020) cleaning up the trail from fallen trees and over growth.\r\n\nCAUTION: The trail is well-worn and marked so it is easy to follow, except for a poorly-marked and easily-missed turn to the north where the Yellow Trail overlaps the Orange Trail. Be aware of this because it is easy to miss and continue on the Orange Trail without realizing it. \n\nI believe there are three creek crossings on this trail. If you park in the horse parking lot and start by going southwest, there is one right at the beginning, but it can be crossed using a large fallen tree.
