It is a great training trail with beautiful architecture, masonry, craftsmanship, and history in a surprisingly forested setting so close to downtown. There are two parking areas.  Located at the bottom of the trail near the South Side Bridge is the Justice Row parking lot. There is also public parking available on Crawford Road at the top of the trail in view of the former Governor's Mansion. The trail is located 5-10 minutes from the I-77/I-64 junction in Charleston. The trail switchbacks its way up the hillside with gentle grades and beautiful craftsmanship throughout.  \r\n\nThe trail was originally built by Governor William A. MacCorkle in 1905 to transport building materials drawn by oxen to the top of the hill to construct the Governor's Mansion, also known as the Sunrise Mansion. Instead of pulling the materials up the nearby steep Bridge Road, MacCorkle purchased the wooded land to create a gentler grade that would be easier for the oxen pulling the materials.  Apparently, while digging the trailbed, MacCorkle himself uncovered a Civil War gravesite of two women who were thought to be spies and executed, though there are conflicting stories as to which side executed and buried the women. \r\n\nThe more than century old stone walls are often patched up with imprints of local leaves set into them. There is also a small shrine on one of the switchbacks that the Governor erected after his daughter was killed in an automobile accident. The trail ends at the top of the hill at the Sunrise Mansion, where MacCorkle began his horse-drawn carriage rides down the trail each morning on his way to the capitol building.  \r\n\nPlease take care of this beautiful trail and donated property and strive to leave it in better condition than you found it.

As the era of coal in the New River Gorge tapered to an end, sadly so did the town. At a current population of 5 residents according to the 2010 census, Thurmond doesn't have many residents to tell its story.

It is a bit off the beaten path. Access is from the rear of Kanawha State Forest.  \r\n\nAt the end of the paved road, two dirt roads will bear off on the left. Take the left road of these two roads, Middle Ridge Road (Forest Rd. 801) for approximately a quarter mile. Then, at an intersection, Middle Ridge Road (Forest Rd. 801) will bear left. Turn right onto another gas well access road (East Boundary Road).  \r\n\nStay on this road for approximately 1.3-1.4 miles. About 0.6 miles into this road, there is an intersection where you'll want to bear left. At about 1.25 miles in, at the top of a rise, there is another intersection. Stay to the right. The trail entrance is just down the hill from here. The access to Wall Fork is on your left. It is not well marked, but there is a power line cut that crosses the road. The trail entrance is on the left just before the power line cut, so if you start back up the hill and go past the power lines, you have gone too far.  \r\n\nThe trail starts out under the power lines in high grass. After a short time, it will enter the trees and opens up a bit. It will run on a gas well road for a short distance, then it will bear off to the left into the woods. From here, it is a narrow trail that is off-camber and benched into the side of the hill. There are several more technical, rocky sections.  \r\n\nThen, as the trail drops in elevation, it begins to transition from rock gardens to a more open, flowing trail. Finally, towards the bottom, it runs along the creek bottom before ending on County Rt. 23/15 (Range Rd.) very close to the Kanawha State Forest shooting range. The range is on the left as the trail outlets and is close to the trail. The range is popular and crowded and it will sound as if shooting is very close\u2014because it is. This can be a bit disconcerting, so stay alert, especially when the leaves are out as the leaves obscure the range from view.\r\n\nHikers can then take Hoffman Hollow back up the hill to the rear of the forest to access Middle Ridge Trail.

The trail enters the tree line almost directly opposite from County Road Trail near the exit from the driveway for the parking area/shelter that is below the baseball field at the top of the hill.  \r\n\nIt meanders through the woods and around several holes of the park's Frisbee golf course. There are a number of footpaths in this area made by Frisbee golfers that you can hike for variety, but the main path is fairly well-traveled.  \r\n\nThe trail terminates along Little Creek Park Rd. on the other side of the ridge. The exit of the trail is the only tricky part, as there is a short descent with a water break and a ditch line along the road that must be crossed.  \r\n\nFrom here, hikers can cross the road and continue on to Rocky Ridge Trail, MD40 Loop, BBQ and others.", "condition": "Unknown"}, "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 0.2, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [885, 861], "alt-change": [24, 5], "avg-grade": 2.0, "max-grade": 7.0}},
