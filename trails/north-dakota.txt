Beautiful vistas of the river-cut valley abound.\r\n\nThe MDH can be broken down into sections, each anchored by campgrounds along the route: the southern end starts just south of Medora at Sully Creek State Park. The trail heads north and goes through the south unit of Theodore Roosevelt National Park and Cottonwood Campground is near the trail. The MDH exists at the north end of the south unit and continues to Wannagan Campground. From Wannagan the trail continues to Elkhorn Campground and the nearby Elkhorn Unit of Theodore Roosevelt National Park. After Elkhorn, the next campground is Magpie. Then Bennett Campground is 3.2 miles off the trail, accessible by the Bennett Trail. Near the north end, the Summit Campground is accessible by the 3.8 mile Summit Trail. Finally, the Maah Daah Hey Trail ends at the CCC Campground, just south of the north unit of Theodore Roosevelt National Park.\r\n\nWater cache boxes are available along the trail for long-distance or thru hikes.

This is a small facility off exit 32 of Interstate 94. It is a dual visitor center and highway rest area. It is a popular place for travelers to take a quick break and look over the rim into Painted Canyon below. \r\n\nAt the east end of the parking lot, there is a trailhead sign with a map. It pays to examine the map and note how far the trail traverses along the rim before starting its descent (about 0.5 mile) because there are numerous well-traveled bison trails in the area that could easily divert a hiker. \r\n\nFrom the trailhead, follow a gravel road east. It turns into a two-track dirt trail as you pass two fenced air-quality and weather monitoring stations, that also have a webcam. Continue east/southeast past the fenced septic lagoon for the rest area - at this point the two-track road turns into a hiking trail. There should be a marker ahead where the trail turns down off the rim; however, markers are difficult to maintain in the park because bison use them as scratching posts.  \r\n\nShortly after starting the descent, there is a box for visitors to register. The descent continues from this point and levels out as it passes through some gullies create by intermittent streams. At about the halfway point, hikers pass through a sagebrush flats area. Then the trail dips into a deep gully and back up to rolling grasslands. \r\n\nAt the north end, it meets the Upper Paddock Creek Trail and one could continue northwest or southeast on that trail.
