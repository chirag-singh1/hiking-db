The best option when staying close to Bentonville.\r\n\nThe Back 40 Loop is a rolling singletrack trail of typical NW AR hardwood forest, but also housing and even a golf course. If you are seeking a sense of isolation, you'll get that for stretches, but you'll also not have it for other stretches. \r\n\nThe trail is designed for mountain bikers and that is what you are likely to see when you're out there. However, I must say, they are the friendliest and most considerate mountain bikers I have encountered in my travels. That being said, you'll have to deal with sections of trail that are typical of MTB designed trails such as the rolls and unnecessary switchbacks. \r\n\nThe  TH location shown on this page is simply a pull off on the side of the road. 2 proper THs are on the trail that have water (during the 'not freezing' season) and porta potties. One is at Gaylord and Lanceshire and the other is about 4 miles CW from the starting point here (Buckingham, I believe). \r\n\nGiven the starting point shown on this page, if you follow the path and go CCW you'll start off paralleling roads. You'll cross several streets and may become a bit disillusioned (as I did, initially) that this would be a painful 22 miles along roads. It got better, but then a lot worse when I started essentially running through a development and then the aforementioned golf course, actually crossing through the golf course at some point. \r\n\nFret not, about a mile past the golf course, after being a little to intimate with the surrounding development, things quickly get better (perhaps that first few mile just reset expectations). \r\n\nFrom that point on, it was a lovely run. There were road crossings and there would be houses at the top of the ridges occasionally, but these were removed enough and mixed with enough total isolation to make it enjoyable. \r\n\nNotes: \r\n\nThe trail is very easy to follow and all intersections are well marked. \r\n\nMy Strava said this was 18 miles with 3000 ft of elevation gain. Not sure who to believe. \r\n\nThere are only two bathrooms (both porta potties) along this root. If you run this, and tend to need facilities, you'll not have much privacy for the first several miles. I tend to need them early on then not need them as the run goes on. If this is the case for you, perhaps running clockwise is the way to go as there is a porta at the TH about 4 miles in and another at about the halfway point, as well as more isolation to make you feel comfortable doing what you must. \r\n\nWater may need to be staged when fountains not on", "features": "Fall Colors \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Waterfall \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7024526/bridge-alone-the-southern-portion-of-the-back-40-loop", "ratings": {"rating": 3.8, "num_reviewers": 5}, "stats": {"dist": 22.0, "dist-type": "Loop", "alt-range": [1362, 993], "alt-change": [1637, 1643], "avg-grade": 3.0, "max-grade": 15.0}},

There are a few bluffs and ups and downs over low hills in this area, but soon the trail follows the river on relatively flat terrain until reaching mile marker 202 at AR highway 10.\r\n\nAt mile 202, the trail turns north to cross the Lake Maumelle highway bridge.  Immediately after the highway bridge, the trail re-enters the forest and follows the northern edge of Lake Maumelle until reaching Highway 300 in Little Rock near Pinnacle Mountain State Park.  \r\n\nThe OT then follows Hwy 300, crossing an historic iron bridge over the Maumelle River, and reaches the southwest corner of Pinnacle Mountain State Park.

Weatherproof topographical maps of the trail can be purchased from Charlie. For more information on how to purchase a map click here.\r\n\nThe trail begins on the northeast side of the Cripple Turkey parking lot. Follow the blue blazes.\r\n\nAt about 4.3 miles the trail turns south. At 4.7 miles it crosses Barkshed Creek and Cole Road. Barkshed will be your first water. In about a half mile, the trail climbs to the steep side of Barkshed valley and stays there until it reaches the Sylamore valley.\r\n\nIn the Sylamore valley, the trail stays high most of the time. At about 7.9 miles, the trail heads downhill towards river level.\r\n\nAt 9.4 miles, the trail comes out to the road at Barkshed Rec Area. Turn left and cross the old iron bridge. From the iron bridge, the trail follows the road as it exits the recreation area on the east side and turns south into the woods at the big sign.\r\n\nAfter a mile or so, the trail comes out of a long overhang, pinches through some rocks and then climbs out to a small overlook. A quick turn to the left and then trail begins its descent to Glades Branch. At the branch, the trail is close enough to Sylamore Creek to give easy access. Then it climbs to another bluff.\r\n\nThe trail descends again, comes alongside the creek and joins FR 1102, Gunner Road. Cross the bridge (mile 13.0) and enter Gunner Pool Rec Area. Stay on the main road leaving the recreation area to the south. Just past the main sign, the trail leaves the road to the left and heads into the woods.\r\n\nThe trail reaches the bottom of the hill, crosses a small bridge (15.1 miles) and enters a small prairie. The trail soon picks up an old forest road and follows the creek for about a half mile. At mile 16.3, the trail leaves the road to the left, and stays on the side off the mountain for a little over a mile. At about 17.3 miles, the trail begins its descent to the Blanchard Spring Rec Area.\r\n\nFollow the road across it to an old building where the trail heads back into the woods. At mile 21, the trail crosses Slick Rock Hollow. Your approach to the creek is a set of stone stairs that brings you to the creek side. Cross the creek, cross the field, and you are at the trailhead.

Folklore says local children would hear the bombers arrival and run to watch them fly through the valley and over the lake as they practiced dry run releases with bombardiers opening their hatches and pretending to blow up the dam.  \r\n\nFolklore is disputed, however, some say that the current Ward Dam was built by the WPA in the mid 1930's, while others bring up a 1905 date which would place the dam out of the New Deal Era. Folklore also tells of a dam break and of the subsequent flooding of the town below as a result. \r\n\nIn recent Mena news, trespassing on the current Ward Dam was deemed punishable by fine as locals were concerned about the erosion being caused by teenagers and 4x4 enthusiasts who were creating tire ruts from driving straight up the dam face in tests of testosterone and tire torque. Ruts in a dam become holes in a dike.\r\n\nRecent trends in environmental conservation question the validity of dams. Ponder this as you head out on the trail: Futility.

The two diverge and rejoin at points to keep the horses away from the steep slopes or cliff faces.\r\n\nShallow (waste deep) swimming can be had at the ford or at the Richland creek crossing. Be careful around rivers to avoid strong currents. The Richland Valley Elk Conservation Area borders Wollum Ford so don't be surprised to see Elk in this area! \r\n\nStarting from Woolum Ford, the very first thing is a waist deep crossing of the Richland Creek, then a steep staircase up the bluff to a long switchback up the ridge. The horses rejoin here and the trail can be be difficult the first 3mi or so depending on if the horses tore up the tred while it was muddy recently.\r\n\nEventually, the tread shapes up to what you expect and opens up to spectacular views of the Buffalo River valley. The trail tops every bluff along the way which means there is a lot of up-and-downing as it winds through ravines and tributaries. Take note though, these creeks are often dry or only a trickle so, careful water management  must be observed.\r\n\nThe payoff is spectacular views from the very edge of the Buffalo's chalk cliffs. And yes, you'll climb up to every one of them along this route. \r\n\nThe last few miles is a road walk on various forest roads until the border of Tyler Bend where the trail turns off and up to the Collier Homestead historical site. To get t Tyler Bend visitor center, you must tun off the OHT/BRT proper here and take the park trail (not included in the GPS track).

At the top of the climb the singletrack narrows, climbing a bit again. The trail then climbs through a rocky glade area right on top of a knob.

There are some cool views of the south face of Rattlesnake Ridge from here. The trail once again drops through rocky trails until you come to a split at the Tombstone Rock. A black diamond line goes to the left of the Tombstone and an easier blue line goes around to the right. Careful here as the blue line is still somewhat in progress. Both lines come back together and drop through some boulders before dropping one final time off the ridge.  \r\n\nFrom here, the trail smooths out quickly towards the road crossing.
