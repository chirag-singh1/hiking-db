An easy 1/2 mile out-and-back spur to the left heads out to Lover's Leap, an observation platform hanging over a cliff in a secluded pine forest. Turning right, you'll begin Trail 2.\r\n\nThe trail first heads into a small valley with a bridge before climbing a flight of stairs. At the top of the stairs, you'll have the decision to take the loop clockwise or counterclockwise. If you go clockwise, you'll head down the massive staircase at Steamboat Rock, but you'll have to make the long and difficult hike up Pearl Ravine. For this description, we will be going counterclockwise, which I prefer.\r\n\nTurning right at the T, the trail will stay mostly high up and flat until around the 0.6 mile mark. At this point, the trail will descend a steep hill into the Pearl Ravine valley. The trail will now follow the bottom of the ravine until it empties into Sugar Creek. Pearl Ravine has many boulders and downed trees to maneuver, and the rock surface is often very slick. About halfway down, you'll pass Maidenhair Falls, a waterfall about ten feet tall next to a sandstone bluff with a staircase. Keep in mind that this ravine might not have any water running through it, or it could have a lot. Pay attention to the weather the day before you head out on this trail.\r\n\nUpon arriving at Sugar Creek, you'll have a peaceful area to rest and enjoy the scenery before ascending the stairs at Steamboat Rock. I have seen people fishing here but I am not sure if it is technically allowed. The stairs at Steamboat Rock should not be underestimated. They are long and very steep. There are a few places to stop and rest on the way up or down, however. The stairs are deceiving because once you think they might be done, they keep going. There is a view of Sugar Creek from the bluff at the top. Be careful in this area due to the cliffs.

This stretch is very flat, and hikes through an old pine plantation featuring white, Jack, and scotch pines as well as Norway spruce trees. Note that this blend of northern forest is typical of Ontario, not Indiana. You'll have to return this way at the end of the hike.\r\n\nOnce the terrain begins to change, you'll arrive at Turkey Backbone. This area is very similar to the Red River Gorge in Kentucky, characterized by steep cliffs and narrow ridgelines, sometimes only four or five feet wide at the top. While not a perfect vertical drop, you can see the creekbed beneath you on both sides of the trail. After crossing the backbone, the trail descends to the bottom of the Clifty Creek valley. There are two short loops down here. Turn right.\r\n\nOnce the trail meets Clifty Creek, follow the creekbed to the left. Here is the site of a wool mill built in 1870. The mill only existed for three years before being moved. On Mill Cut Backbone, the ridge opposite of you, you may see a cut in the rock. This is all that remains from the Mill.\r\n\nContinuing downstream, you'll come across The Slide to your right. This is an area of frequent rockslides caused by freezing and thawing rock. Heading away from the creek, take the first right you come to and follow the trail until another junction. Turn right and cross the creek. Now you are about to climb the famous Devil's Backbone.\r\n\nYou'll come to a large rock wall. Follow the wall to the right until you can climb on top of it. Follow the top of the backbone across. At the top, the trail is only six feet wide with 100-foot drops on both sides. Look for carvings at the top. The backbone gets its name from a large carving of the devil made in 1910. There are also several carvings of passenger pigeons, which have been extinct since 1914. I have never been able to locate either of these carvings, so don't spend too long trying to find them. Instead, enjoy the view of Indian Creek from the top.\r\n\nAfter descending the backbone, you'll come to the intersection of Clifty Creek and Indian Creek, as well as Honeycomb Rock. The 300 million-year-old rock face in front of you was once part of the bottom of a shallow sea. Easier dissolvable rocks and fossils have since been eroded from the surrounding sandstone, resulting in a very bizarre cliff. Turn left and follow Clifty Creek upstream and complete the second loop.

Hike through a forest dominated by maple, beech, basswood, and oak trees. Follow a stretch of the Little Calumet River, once a critical transportation route for early regional travelers. Explore the recently restored Mnok Prairie for a glimmer of the vast stretches of pre-settlement grasslands.\r\n\nVisit the Bailly Homestead and Chellberg Farm to glimpse how families lived and farmed in Northwest Indiana. \r\n\nThe Bailly Homestead, a National Historic Landmark (1962), was the home of Honore Gratien Joseph Bailly de Messein (1774 - 1835). Bailly played a role in the development of the Calumet Region of northern Indiana. He was an independent trader in the extensive fur-trading network that spread from Montreal to Louisiana, and ultimately to Europe. Joseph Bailly was one of the earliest settlers in northern Indiana. In 1822, Bailly set up his fur trading post at the crossroads of several important trails.

Upon reaching the road for a second time, the trail offers great views of the lake and a great spot to enjoy some water or a snack.\r\n\nWhen you're ready to continue, the trail makes a sharp left turn to climb gently along the banks of Big Run. With roughly half a mile of creekside trail (which is actually only running after heavy rains or flooding), you'll have plenty of time to enjoy its pleasant company. After rejoining the White Blaze Trail briefly, the end of the trail is met with its most interesting feature: the underground waterfall.\r\n\nCascading under the surface, this waterfall is only visible through a small opening in the ground that's partially covered by rocks and detritus. Further adding to its novelty is the lack of visible water anywhere else around it, and the large hills to its sides. For those that know a thing or two about groundwater, this can be an interesting spot to give a lesson to those uninitiated.\r\n\nOnce you've enjoyed the waterfall to your heart's content, you can either return the way you came, or you can jump onto the White Blaze Trail to extend your pleasant experience in these Indiana woodlands.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Cave \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 Lake \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Spring \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Waterfall \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7029520/this-is-a-video-of-a-skylight-with-a-springwaterfall", "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 1.2, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [683, 453], "alt-change": [102, 235], "avg-grade": 5.0, "max-grade": 18.0}},

Hold left at the fork and head toward the campground. A day-use parking area is on the north side of the road just before the campground loop. There is an informational kiosk on the east side of the parking area with a trail map and other important information. (Another trailhead parking area exists on the north side of the loop off of Gerald Road.)\r\n\nAlong this trail, you'll see a variety of forest management techniques, rock outcroppings that are more visible in the winter, remnants of old farmsteads, several creeks with water cascading over rocks, and a small waterfall.\r\n\nThe trail system is nicely laid out in a ladder system, so users can make shorter or longer loops through the recreation area. The outer loop as mapped here is marked with blue diamond blazes, and three connector trails are marked in orange diamonds. Notice there are some very challenging hills in the trail profile, but luckily they are spaced out well to give your legs a break between climbs. Most of the big hills have some switchbacks to ease the gradient, but you'll occasionally wish there were more.\r\n\nThis is a multi-use trail that is popular with horseback riders and less popular for mountain biking. As a result of the horse traffic, expect soft spots in trails to be chewed up, but they can usually be bypassed on foot. The trail surface varies significantly. Portions of the trail are sprinkled with gravel to stabilize the mud or control erosion, and some sections use service roads, but it's nearly all covered by the tree canopy.

Soon after leaving the parking lot, the trail forks into two. Since this is a loop trail, you can reasonably take either option, but it is more popular to begin by taking the western fork as opposed to the northwestern fork. \r\n\nAssuming that you continued on the western fork, you'll experience a straight and level trail all the way to Pipewort Pond. This portion of the trail traverses a mixed meadow habitat, with some areas of encroaching woodland. The trail is generally well maintained and rarely overgrown. Eventually, the trail widens into a mowed grove, and it is here that a small spur of the trail continues west to a boardwalk that overlooks the pond. The boardwalk is in average condition and is a good place to spot some interesting amphibians, reptiles, and birds. \r\n\nFrom the grove, the main trail continues north and parallels the pond. This part of the trail is more wooded and occasionally experiences deadfall. A small overlook spurs off the trail and provides near-panoramic views of the pond during winter, spring, and fall. This area is also home to a few unmarked trails that are more distinguishable during certain seasons than others. \r\n\nAfter paralleling the pond, the trail makes two abrupt right turn back into the meadow. This is by far the least visited part of the trail as many visitors only hike to the boardwalk and overlook before turning back the way that they came. It is relatively flat and wide, but offers some opportunity for wildlife viewing. This portion of the trail eventually leads back to the fork by the parking lot, completing the loop.\r\n\nPipewort Pond is owned and maintained by the state of Indiana and was created to help protect a rare ecosystem.

I have heard them and seen their nests but have never seen the birds themselves.\r\n\nThe next section of the trail travels in between the water and the Scenic Trail and makes its way through thick brush. From miles 1.5 to 3.5, the trail is very overgrown with stickers, thorns, and saplings. There are a few breaks in the foliage during the multiple stream crossings. The largest stream on the trail is at 2.5 miles. From mile 2.5 to 3.0, there is a significant lack of blazes and it is easy to lose the trail. This trail is probably the worst kept trail in the Brookville Lake trail system, which is a shame because it has a lot of potential and could be a fantastic backcountry trail with some much needed maintenance. There needs to be new blazes painted on trees throughout the entire trail, and the trail itself needs to be cleared from all of the young plants beginning to grow and conceal the path. I would not recommend this trail in the warmer months unless you love ticks and thorns on your legs.\r\n\nAfter mile 3.5, the trail widens significantly and may follow an abandoned unpaved road (I don't have evidence of this) and heads uphill. The rest of the trail offers occasional views of Brookville Lake and is fairly high up. The end of the trail enters another area of pine trees and crosses a small footbridge. The trail intersects the Scenic Trail at the large wooden bridge. Turn left to return to the beginning of the trail. Turn right to head towards the dam and the Eagle Trail.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Commonly Backpacked \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 Lake \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "All Clear"}, "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 4.3, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [965, 781], "alt-change": [653, 473], "avg-grade": 5.0, "max-grade": 24.0}},
