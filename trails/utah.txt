I would rather just hike it.

The trail climbs a little bit and crosses over a few creek beds (can be marshy in the spring and early summer). Then there are a series of switchbacks that lead you above the canyon so that you can then follow the north side of the ridge between City Creek Canyon and North Canyon. Most of this portion of the trail is shaded by large pine trees.\r\n\nSoon, the trail comes out onto the top of the ridge and follows the ridgeline to Rudy's Flat, a beautiful meadow at about 7,150 feet. Rudy's Flat serves as a junction for three trails: the North Canyon Trail, the Mueller Park Trail, and the North Fork Trail out of City Creek Canyon. There is also a trail that heads east and climbs up to the high mountain ridge above Rudy's Flat.\r\n\nThe area is incredibly green and lush in the spring and early summer, and the fall colors are fantastic.

However you choose to use the trail, watch out for moose and mountain lions.\r\n\nIt's easiest to find this trail starting at Rudy's Flat. It will be the only trail heading south from the flat. Note that soon after leaving the flat, this trail has a north-fork that dead-ends quickly, but not until you've wasted some energy on it. Perhaps at the time of this writing, the fork actually goes somewhere, but when I explored it, it didn't seem to go anywhere.\r\n\nFinding the trail from the City Creek end is a bit trickier. Picnic Site #23 is called \"North Fork,\" and I believe the trail starts just east of this site. (If not this site, one very nearby.) In any case, just look for the picnic site nearest the North Fork of City Creek Canyon. The entrance is a bit tricky to find, but rest assured, once you find it, the trail will not be hard to follow. The path is well worn and well traveled. The entrance is not at the picnic site itself. You must hike up-canyon along the road just a bit to find the entrance.\r\n\nFrom bottom to top, the trail begins by staying in the canopy until you reach a switch-back that helps you gain a ridge. You then follow the ridge more or less until you re-enter some forest before emerging onto the flat.

Unfortunately, this gate is always locked and (although everyone is free to go and use this trail) you'll need to jump over the fence or the gate to get onto the trail. \r\n\nThe trail itself drops down to where Millville Creek crosses under the road through a culvert, and you approach another gate that needs to be jumped over. Luckily, this is the last one of the trail. Once you pass the gate, the trail starts to go up and down the rolling foothills of the Bear River Range as it heads toward Blacksmith Fork Canyon.\r\n\nThe first couple of miles are fairly easy with not much elevation change, and then as the last mile approaches a couple of steep drops occur as the trail drops down the terraces of the Blacksmith Fork River and down to water level. Eventually, the river comes into view and then passes right by the trail (on the other side of the deer fence) which is scenic and beautiful. \r\n\nSoon after, the trail narrows down to singletrack that goes up and over some rocky parts and then drops down into a very shady section with some thick trees around it. There is a gate that is locked in the winter when the elk are calving in the Millville Face Wildlife Management Area, but it is open during the rest of the year. Go through this gate and the trail goes up and around a spring that feeds a small creek that flows into the Blacksmith Fork River (and if you take the trail that goes closest to the small fence, you can avoid a small creek crossing). The trail eventually drops back into the shaded forested area, and then crosses a small fence to get to the parking area in Blacksmith Fork Canyon.\r\n\nThis trail is a great, easy trail and a fun way of getting to Blacksmith Fork Canyon from other parts of the valley. It also offers great views of Cache Valley and the surrounding mountains (Gunsight Peak, the Wellsvilles, etc.) and you can often see deer along the route if you go early enough in the morning.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7007568/a-view-of-the-sunrise-over-the-trail", "ratings": {"rating": 3.3, "num_reviewers": 3}, "stats": {"dist": 3.1, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [4919, 4742], "alt-change": [142, 254], "avg-grade": 2.0, "max-grade": 8.0}},

Before long, the creek can be seen from the trail and flows year round. The trail steepens in parts and in other parts it flattens out as it follows the creek through sprawling meadows. \r\n\nAlthough there are many spurs from this trail, at about 2.5 miles there is a junction with another jeep road off to the right (south) that goes up to an overlook of Blacksmith Fork Canyon (the South Fork Millville Canyon - FR 023 trail), which is a worthwhile destination. \r\n\nAt about 3.25 miles or so, there is a big curve in the road where you can look back and get some great views of the Wellsvilles, and not long after that there is another spur trail (to the left/north this time) called the Big Baldy Trail that traverses under Big Baldy to get to Providence Canyon. After a little over 4 miles, the trail reaches an overlook where you can see down into Blacksmith Fork Canyon, Leatham Hollow, and the surrounding mountains and cliffs. The trail levels out at this point for a mile or so as it contours along the head of Leatham Hollow, and then starts to ascend again as it heads toward Millville Pass (the point over 8800 feet below Millville Peak).\r\n\nFrom Millville Pass, the trail descends gradually through beautiful alpine forests of aspen and pines as the trail heads in the direction of Logan Peak. Some of the aspens along this route are massive and very tall, they are especially gorgeous in the fall when they are changing colors but are impressive year round. The trail doesn't drop very far before it reaches a large basin, and then starts to ascend again. \r\n\nAfter it starts to ascend again, it passes the fork in the trail where another jeep road heads off to Logan Peak and Providence Lake and continues on. The road ascends and descends gradually through some rolling hills until it reaches another set of forks - one that goes on to Inspiration Point and the North Syncline Trail, and then soon after that the Spring Hollow Trail.

It can be done as an extremely long day hike or as a two or even three day pack. The lack of reliable water for a long portion of the middle of the trek adds to its difficulty.\r\n\nWhether done in a day or as a backpack (permit required), Upper Spring is a point-to-point hike that requires a shuttle between the two trailheads or a 3.9-mile road hike back to the starting point. The shuttle vehicle or a bike should be left at the Chimney Rock Trailhead, which is 3.1 miles west of the visitor center on Highway 24. Please note that you'll have to make your exit on the Chimney Rock Trail and the Chimney Rock Canyon before reaching the parking area. Parking is available on the outside of the circle, and there is a pit toilet. \r\n\nTo start the journey, drive west to the Holt Draw Trailhead which is 7.0 miles west of the visitor center on Highway 24 at milepost 72.4, outside of the park. A short track heads north from the pavement, ending in 150 yards at a fence. Park there, or closer to the paved road if the track is too rough for your vehicle.\r\n\nFor more than a mile, the route follows an old road and then the stream bed of Sulphur Creek at a gentle grade. A steep climb out of the drainage leads to a pleasant stroll across the high bench of Cooks Mesa to the base of the climb up through the fabled \u201cW,\u201d a passage through a wall of red Wingate sandstone. Minor scrambling is required to pass through the cleft and descend to Upper Spring Canyon. After passing one significant obstacle and several smaller ones, the journey down canyon is easy going. \r\n\nAfter reaching the end of Upper Spring Canyon in a triple junction with Chimney Rock Canyon and Lower Spring Canyon, follow Chimney Rock Canyon to your shuttle vehicle or bike. The way out to Chimney Rock Canyon and the Chimney Rock Trail is preceded by a lovely section of mature cottonwoods under heavily veiled Wingate walls.\r\n\nThis content was contributed by author Rick Stinchfield.

The trail passes among pinyon pine and Utah juniper and smaller semi-desert plants such as sage, rabbitbrush, and Indian paintbrush. It mostly runs next to red-rock cliffs that are part of the Entrada layer, formed from sedimentary deposits laid down during the Jurassic Period. It passes both small and towering pipes, which are narrow towers of harder rock that were left behind as the surrounding softer rock eroded away.  \r\n\nThe special feature of this trail is that it enters two box canyons. Box canyons have a single narrow entrance leading to a wide area that is completely surrounded by high cliffs. I was expecting something small, bounded by low red rock cliffs. Instead, I was astounded by their actual size. These are true box canyons surrounded by cliffs over 800 feet high. In both cases, the trail goes in a little ways to the main opening of the box. From there, it is possible to continue a short distance up little side canyons, but they quickly become impassible unless you are a rock climber.   \r\n\nOnce you have exited the second box canyon, you have seen the primary features and it is only a short distance to a junction where you can either turn left to return back to the parking lot or turn right to go towards the Basin Campground or to connect to the Angel's Palace Trail.", "features": "Views \u00b7 Wildflowers", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7034216/entrance-to-box-canyon-on-grand-parade-trail-the-wide-open-area-is-about-100-yar", "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 1.2, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [5842, 5794], "alt-change": [75, 73], "avg-grade": 2.0, "max-grade": 6.0}},

Kachina Bridge presides over the confluence of White Canyon and Armstrong Canyon. It is considered the geologically \"youngest\" of the three bridges in the National Monument because less erosion has chipped away at the span leaving it thicker than the others. The bridge is named for the Kachina dancers that play a central role in Hopi religious tradition. \r\n\nFrom the parking area, briefly follow the paved Kachina Bridge Overlook Trail before taking a left onto the natural Kachina Bridge Trail. Descend some slickrock sections with the aid of handrails and the friction of your shoes. Then follow steps cut into the rock and a series of many, many stone steps engineered into stairway-like precision. After more switchbacks, you arrive at a junction with the Kachina to Owachomo Trail. This is the long, inner-canyon \"loop\" trail that visits all three bridges in the monument. Staying right to continue along the Kachina Bridge Trail, traverse another bench near a pour-over and drop into the wash at the bottom of the canyon using a log ladder.  \r\n\nFrom here, follow the cairns along the stream to the surprisingly thick Kachina Bridge. The bridge spans White Canyon where it joins Armstrong Canyon. The steep canyon walls often provide welcome shade here in this peaceful grotto. A great deal of impressive rock art can be found under the right-hand side of the arch above a small ledge and also further under the bridge. Both pictographs (painted images) and petroglyphs (scratched images) are visible, showing dancing figures, animals, symbols and hand prints.  \r\n\nBudget enough time to laze around in this sandy oasis, making up stories about what the petroglyphs mean, having a snack, or taking a nap. On your return trip, be sure to stay to the left as you pass back under the bridge, that way you retrace your steps back up Armstrong Canyon (instead of heading right down White Canyon and out of the park).  Take breaks on the steep ascent and, as always, bring adequate water and sun protection.\r\n\nAs the park's brochures and info boards explain, natural bridges are created differently than arches.

Follow the trail that goes from this sign into the woods beyond. In the woods, the trail immediately starts ascending, although it is a very gradual ascent that continues throughout the first three miles of the trail. The first part of the trail is very interesting because there is a mixture of large rocks and forest, aspen and pine, and it's all very beautiful. The trail itself is also interesting because I believe it was renovated for mountain bikers, so there are several berms and bumps that would probably be really fun on a mountain bike, and are pretty fun on foot as well. After a couple of miles, the trail starts to switchback up a hillside, and as the switchbacks reach the top of their ascent, the view opens up to where you get a great view of Gog and Magog, as well as the cirque headwall right above White Pine Lake, to the west. Mount Naomi sits in the backdrop as well. \r\n\nAt this point, most of the climbing has been done and the trail drops into a pretty flat section through a beautiful conifer forest as it contours around a mountain, and eventually drops down into a large deforested basin with a small pond to the right of the trail. This is a beautiful area, especially in the morning as the sunlight breaks through and shines on the dew that rests on the grasses and sagebrush in the basin. However, just as quickly as the forest opened up into the basin, it swallows the trail again as it ascends slowly to the high point of the trail. From the high point in the forest, the trail drops quickly via a set of short switchbacks into the Peter Sinks area, which is a great contrast to the forest that the trail has been going through for most of its course. Peter Sinks is a vast, almost treeless basin with expansive views in all directions. It has a lot of sagebrush and grasses, but trees only very sparsely populate this area, which is most likely due to the temperatures. On just about any given day, the sinks are generally about 10-15 degrees cooler than the surrounding areas. It is a great area though. \r\n\nAfter dropping into the Peter Sinks area, the trail continues for another half mile or so, passing by large cairns (many of them are about 2 feet tall) along a really neat rocky ridge that separates two parts of the sinks, which allows for great views of the talus in the sinks, as well as the rock outcroppings above.

This description will describe the route in its entirety from the split from the White Pinel- Bunchgrass Canyon Trail to its end at the Boss Canyon Trail (where the trail on the ridge turns into the North Fork High Creek Trail).\r\n\nFrom the White Pine-Bunchgrass Canyon Trail, the Doubletop Trail splits off (about 1.5 miles up the canyon from the White Pine Canyon Trail junction) and crosses the creek to the north side of the canyon. From here the trail starts to very gradually ascend through the sagebrush meadows, roughly paralleling the creek. There are plenty of cattle trails in this area, so make sure you're on the main trail. A little over half a mile from the trail junction, another spur trail can be seen going off to the right with a sign for the Shorty's Cutoff Trail, which leads over to the Steam Mill Canyon Trail, and eventually all the way over to the Steep Hollow Road FR 289. \r\n\nAfter this trail junction, the trail starts to ascend a little bit more steeply and starts to head toward the northern wall of the canyon. As it nears the ridge, the trail switches back once and then roughly follows a drainage up to the ridge top. Then the trail heads north and passes by Pika Peak (the unofficially named peak just to the east as you get to the top of the ridge) and continues, dipping down and back up again as it heads towards Doubletop Mountain. Soon the trail passes a junction with the Steam Mill Canyon Trail and continues north along the ridge. The trail can be indistinct in places, but generally follows the ridge and occasionally drops down behind a small peak to avoid the elevation gain. \r\n\nAlthough the views of Doubletop from the south aren't as impressive as from Steep Hollow or other places, it is still an incredible mountain and one of the most impressive in the Bear River Range. Eventually, the trail passes just below the South Summit and drops down into the notch between the two summits and passes back around the west side of the North summit.\r\n\nIt is worth it to summit both, as each offers a different view of the area, and the north peak is an especially fun scramble.

This is where the climbing starts to pick up.  \r\n\nIt gets steep pretty quickly and starts going in towards the canyon.  Adequate tree coverage makes for a nice cool hike, and great terrain.  The last climb to the slate field is a brutal one, and is what to expect the rest of the way to the top.  It will be pretty obvious when you reach the slate field, as there are no trees, and many rocks.  \r\n\nFor the sake of your sanity, you can turn around here to enjoy the downhill and the scenery, or you can choose your fate and try to climb to the top.  As I said, that last climb is just a taste of what the next 4 miles hold.  Steep sections will hold a whole new meaning in your life after this. But to those who conquer, we salute you.  \r\n\nThis advanced trail is extremely steep and rocky which makes the downhill worth it in the end.  After this slate field, there will be several sections where you'll grind up a few climbs. These conditions will continue for the next mile until you reach a second slate field.  From here until the top the incline decreases and is easier to hike.  The trail then tops out onto a dirt road near Logan Peak.\r\n\nOn your way down, you'll see little traffic until you reach the first slate field you passed on your way up.  While passing the second slate you field you passed on your way up, get ready for a gnarly, steep and rocky downhill.  Follow the way you came down to the bottom of the singletrack and hook back onto the gravel path to get back to your car.

A description of how to reach Dollar Lake via Henrys Fork Trail can be found on the page for Kings Peak via Henrys Fork.\r\n\nTHIS HIKE IS OFF TRAIL!\r\n\nLeave Henrys Fork Trail at Dollar Lake.  Pass through the campground on the west side of the lake until you reach the shore of Dollar Lake.  A thin trail runs along the west side of the lake and a portion of the south side.  Follow this trail south a short distance till it leaves the trees and meets an open space filled with tall, stiff shrubs.  Find a path through the shrubs and over to the trees that line the east side of the lake.  From here, the route is steep in parts as you move north along the edge of the spur.  Many animal trails crisscross through this part of the route, which can make for easier navigation.  To not get off route, keep the West Spur always to your right.  Through the trees, you'll see the ridge of the West Spur descending as you continue to head north.  Eventually, the trees will thin as you round the point of the spur and enter the large bowl formed by the West Spur and North Ridge of Gilbert Peak.\r\n\nLeaving the trees behind, the route turns east around the point of the spur and enters another open space filled with the same tall, stiff shrubs as earlier.  Begin ascending the spur along its obvious ridge line by beating a path through the shrubs.  About halfway up the spur the shrubs give way to grass and easier movement.  The ridge eventually flattens out a bit as it moves around the bowl.  The navigating along this portion of the route is easy enough, though the patches of grass and rock may slow you down a bit.\r\n\nAs you continue around the bowl, Gilbert Peak is located east and straight ahead.  Gunsight Peak, another 13,000+ feet peak, will be to the south.  An obvious saddle sits between the two peaks.  Continue east to Gilbert Peak.  While the summit of Gunsight Peak appears obvious, the summit of Gilbert Peak is still not visible at this point.  Nevertheless, continue east as the route passes over patches of grass and talus.  Eventually the patches of grass stop and the slopes of Gilbert Peak turn to talus.

The trail undulates as it generally follows Henry's Fork (of the Green River) up through the long drainage. The trail can be very rocky and rooty at times, and is seldom smooth, but it is great for a quick ascent, due to the low grade. \r\n\nThe trail crosses tributary creeks many times, and often has foot bridges (which in some places are slightly dilapidated), but the trail can still get muddy in places, even during the summer, especially when there is a lot of snowmelt. At approximately mile 3.5, the trail heads away from Henry's Fork and out of the forests and into some more open meadows where you can start to get views of the impressive headwalls and peaks around the Henry's Fork drainage. \r\n\nAt approximately mile 5, there is a major crossing of Henry's Fork, but there is a wooden bridge across the river with a handrail that makes the crossing easier. After this crossing, the trees become more and more sparse as the trail heads up into higher elevations, and crosses several more tributary creeks (several of the crossings after the Henry's Fork crossing do not have foot bridges, and the trails can get pretty muddy in the area leading up to Dollar Lake) on the way to Dollar Lake, which is a popular area for camping. Dollar Lake itself cannot be seen from the trail, but the trail passes very close to it and it is worth the quick detour to go and check it out. \r\n\nAfter passing the forested area near Dollar Lake, the basin really opens up and you can get good views of Gunsight Peak, and even the tip of Kings Peak as you head up towards Gunsight Pass. This area is full of great views and wildflowers (in season) and is definitely worth the 8 miles it took to get there. The trail starts to increase in grade slightly at this point as it heads up towards Gunsight Pass. \r\n\nAs the trail nears the base of Gunsight Pass, there is a fork in the trail that allows you to either head straight up towards the pass or to the right along a gradual switchback that also heads up to the pass. Both routes are rocky but the long switchback is more manageable (both up and down). Either way, the trail hits Gunsight Pass, where there is a large rock cairn and some great views into Painter Basin.

It runs through magnificent desert scenery. And aside from its serious remoteness and some up and down, it's a non-threatening hike. Maybe that's what you are looking for.\r\n\nThe best reason to hike here, however, is not for the hiking. It's for the access it provides to incredible slot canyons slicing through the San Rafael Reef. \r\n\nThe first canyons--down to and including Little Wild Horse and Bell--can more easily be accessed from the Goblin Valley side of the Reef.\r\n\nSo why not just drive out the Behind the Reef Road? Because while it is generally easy, there is a very difficult jeep section at Chute Canyon that prevents most vehicle access. This is a good place to park and start your hike, saving several miles and a lot of time, versus beginning at the start of the route where it leaves the Temple Mountain Road. \r\n\nSo, this route is seemingly designed for slot canyon commuting! Hike as far as you like and then hike down one slot canyon, across the reef and up the next canyon, then retrace your route. Good canyons to pair are Crack/Chute, Little Wild Horse/Bell, and Ding/Dang. \r\n\nLittle Wild Horse/Bell are the busiest of all the canyons, the easiest to access, perhaps the most scenic, and completely non-technical: you can take your (active) grandparents through these.\r\n\nIf you intend to go further out the road than this, you may want to camp at the start, and you'll still have to seriously beat feet to have enough daylight to finish before dark.

It appears this trail was finished in the spring of '15.  \r\n\nYou can start at North Ogden Nature Center Trailhead and climb the old jeep trail up to the BST. It's well-marked and fairly obvious. However, this area can see a lot of traffic.  When you get to the trail, head north.  \r\n\nThe first 1/2 mile is fairly rugged. Once you round the corner at the first small canyon (Garner Canyon), stay right and pass over a small bridge (taking the small rocky trail on the left will take you to a canal service road, and you'll have to make a short climb back to the trail).  Climb the 2 switchbacks, and follow the trail for as far as you want to go.  Once you get into the southern entrance of Coldwater Canyon, prepare yourself for a steep, exposed and loose narrow trail. \r\n\nAfter almost all the climbing, you'll reach the eastern end of the canyon and see a pump station on your left and a service road on your right.  I suppose you could bail here, but you've worked hard to get this far... I recommend climbing a little further so you can enjoy a little more of the downhill!  The northern side of the canyon is wider and proves an easier climb out.  \r\n\nDid I mention the views? They're stunning!  You'll climb through several canyons.  They're a great place to cool off, and one might even have water coming down.  The higher you go, the more stunning the views become...

Because of its remote location and virtual inaccessibility, Kolob Arch for years has challenged cowboys, rangers, hikers, climbers, and photographers alike. For most of the twentieth century many believed that Kolob was in fact the worlds largest freestanding arch, leading to years of debate and the motivation for various parties of adventurous thrill seekers to climb on and around the massive span in hopes of securing a defensible measurement.\n\nDespite its isolated location, Kolob Arch has become a favorite backcountry destination for thousands of visitors to Zion. They discover what most arch seekers will tell you: while beauty awaits every seeker at the end of the path, the reward begins unfolding at the trailhead. Along the trail to Kolob Arch lies some of the most beautiful scenery in Zion. Geology becomes art as the La Verkin Creek, with its soothing sounds of life-giving water, sculpts some of the most colorful canyon walls in Southwestern Utah. Awe inspiring views of the Kolob Terrace along the trail give a tired hiker many places to stop and recharge while gazing upon the high plateau country of Zion. \n\nWildlife abounds in these protected canyons and hikers will encounter reptiles, birds, and mammals. Seven miles along the trail, one is rewarded with a sight not seen by most of Zions two and a half million annual visitors, the impressive expanse of Kolob Arch. With a span of 287 feet and a thickness of 75 feet, most experts now agree that Kolob Arch is not the worlds largest span in terms of measurement, but visitors concur with the claim that it is certainly one of the most beautiful and massive arches surrounded and protected by the majestic scenery of Zion.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Cave \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7007862/kolob-arch", "ratings": {"rating": 4.3, "num_reviewers": 4}, "stats": {"dist": 0.5, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [5346, 5225], "alt-change": [122, 0], "avg-grade": 4.0, "max-grade": 6.0}},

The northern portion is very popular among hikers, mountain bikers, equestrians, and motorcyclists, especially on weekends and holidays.\r\n\nLocal flora and fauna highlight the route. The trail provides spectacular views of the Ogden area, from Willard to Antelope Island. It is an outstanding area to view wildflowers and fall colors. The area offers some of the world's oldest geologic formations. Willard and Ben Lomond Peaks are part of the Wasatch Fault, and many fault lines run through the area. \r\n\nThe shorelines of ancient Lake Bonneville can easily be seen from a distance. The higher bench is known as the Bonneville Terrace and the lower bench is called the Provo Terrace. If you are observant at the higher elevations, you may see mountain goats roaming from Willard Peak to Ben Lomond. These animals have been successfully re-introduced into their native habitat. \r\n\nThe west flank of Willard Peak was the site of an iron mine opened in 1873 by Israel Elliott Brown. The company was dissolved when the smelting furnace blew up. A few of the remains may still be seen. The 12 miles of the southern Skyline portion of the trail is heavily used on weekends and holidays but not during the week. A side trail leads to Lewis Peak which is lesser in stature compared to the rugged Ben Lomond Peak, but the climb is just as exhaustive. \r\n\nDuring mid-summer, you'll want to get an early start as the trail's southern exposure and scant forest coverage can make for a warm climb. The trail begins with a steep incline and switchbacks take you from overlooks of Pineview Reservoir to Ogden Canyon's limestone formations. \r\n\nAbout 2.0 miles from Pineview is a very short spur to the right and leads to Lookout Point. At mile 3.0 there are outstanding views of farm and ranch lands in Ogden Valley. The trail curves northeasterly into thick foliage offering some comforting shade. Near mile 5, the trail crosses between Goodall Canyon above Ogden Canyon and the head of Nordic Valley Ski Area. \r\n\nThe trail to Lewis Peak (8,031 feet) is 2.5 miles one-way from the Skyline Trail and is well worth the effort. Return back to the Pineview Trailhead or alternately follow the ridge north toward North Ogden Pass. It is 5.3 miles along the ridge line northward then down to North Ogden Pass.

With trail stops like Inspiration, Sunset, Sunrise and Fairyland Point, it's easy to imagine why this will become one of your all-time favorites.

Insider Tip: do the whole thing, it's worth it! The trail can be traveled in either direction and from half a dozen parking areas and starting points. End to end it measures just shy of 6 miles, so you'll need to either use the free park shuttle, which travels every 15 minutes or so between Sunrise and Bryce Point or prime your legs for a longer hike if going round trip. \r\n\nSouth-to-North (Bryce Point to Fairyland Point) - the less-traveled, but preferred route for scenic buildup and planning. Park at the visitor center and hop on the free shuttle to Bryce Point. From here, absorb the semi-distant view of the main amphitheater to which you'll be heading and that constitutes the bulk of Bryce Canyon. Once ready to hike, enjoy a couple of miles of downhill to warm up the legs as you head ever-closer to the surreal Inspiration Point. Continue along the trail, which turns to pavement and becomes more popular as you approach Sunset Point and the real crowds. Though relatively flat, the next mile will likely be the slowest of your day as you drain the batteries of your cameras and cellphones, and stop for \"just one more look!\" Passing Sunrise Point, you may be tempted to hike backwards, but rest-assured, the views up ahead are just as nice. After reaching the well-earned Fairyland Point overlook, relax and soak it in.

We were told to rent some dry pants so we did. Some of my friends also rented canyoneering shoes and neoprene socks; they loved it. I only have neoprene socks with my Keen sandals; I also loved it. Trekking sticks were very helpful for me, however, not needed. \r\n\nThe trail begins at the parking lot for Left Fork trailhead, starting out pretty flat on a well-maintained trail for about 10 min then it starts to lead you down to the bottom of the canyon. There's a lot of loose rocks coming down this quite steep part. You'll see a sign \"Left Fork Trailhead\" once closer to the bottom of the canyons and the water. \r\n\nOnce at the bottom, start hiking upstream! There are \"obvious\" trails on both side of the creek, one might be easier than the other. There are a lot of water crossings, rock hopping, and some boulder climbing, if you prefer. After hiking for a while from the trailhead sign, the views of the canyons start to open up; it is majestic. There are many small waterfalls along the way created by some boulders in the stream before we hit those \"signature\" cascade waterfalls at almost the end of the hike. \r\n\nThere are beautiful wildflowers in yellow, red, orange, and purple, along with some prickly pears that are budding. We even saw some fish! It is very green during this time of the year. Also, there is supposed to be a dinosaur footprint 2.2 miles in from the parking lot, but unfortunately, we missed it both times (in and out). \r\n\nAt about 15 minutes out from The Subway, this is where my trekking poles were especially helpful. We had to go across the water (not over ankle high) on very slippery rocks a few times. Some groups did not make it to The Subway because they said that the current was too strong (still not over ankle high). But going slowly and firmly helped me! Soon after that, we saw The Subway! (The canyons on both sides came close together to form a tubular \"tunnel\", there was a lot of water in The Subway when we were there). \r\n\nThere are a couple of swimming pools in The Subway area. Not sure how deep but my trekking pole could not reach the bottom of them. It is a little bit more chilly in there. We headed back the same way after taking a ton of pictures.

The best views can be enjoyed by hiking south-to-north from the Cassidy Arch Trail. \r\n\nFrom the southern trail junction, bear right at the sign to begin the climb along a moderate grade that eventually passes the tip of a prominent, white-capped red point. After about two-thirds of a mile, the slope eases, and for the next half mile, the trail passes through a mellow pi\u00f1on-juniper forest that imparts the sense of a garden. A little more than a mile in, the highpoint of the hike is reached. This is a fine place to enjoy lunch.\r\n\nIf the day is hot, just over the highpoint is a small, shaded alcove along the trail. Just off the trail to the right, an open ledge makes an excellent viewpoint. On clear days, the La Sal Mountains east of Moab are visible above the typical Mancos Formation mesas. To the northeast is flat Horse Mesa, capped by the Carmel Formation and swinging further left, the domes in the Navajo Sandstone stand out, especially in low early evening light when they cast long shadows.\r\n\nDuring the long descent that follows, the Frying Pan, essentially a vast canyon, is laid out in full view of the northbound hiker, with a variety of interesting Kayenta erosional structures visible in the distance. The trail continues down the slope of the Kayenta, occasionally dropping from one layer to the next. It is more than a mile from the top to a sandy wash crossing.\r\n\nA worthwhile diversion leads to the right to the top of a high pour-off. This drainage forms the handle of the Frying Pan and extends into the Navajo Sandstone. Under the dryfall is a series of tanks in the bedrock below. They are quite evenly spaced, and the line of eight or nine of them is unusual.\r\n\nOn the main trail and on the other side of the wash crossing, the trail climbs about half a mile to the base of a prominent pillar. Just ahead, a good viewpoint looks into the canyon to the west and a wall of Wingate solution cavities. From the pillar, good views to the north once again emerge.\r\n\nCohab Canyon shortly begins to appear to the west.

In a short distance, mostly natural steps lead up to a section that winds through large, iron-stained sandstone boulders that have fallen from above. A long flat stretch begins as the trail circumvents a deeply incised side drainage, the first of four encountered along the way. After a short climb, the second flat begins, and the pattern continues.\r\n\nThe next ascent highlights the variable conditions under which the sandstone and siltstones of the Kayenta Formation were deposited. Keep an eye on and around the trail for variety of sandstone examples.\r\n\nAs the next flat begins, the Golden Throne comes into view for the first time, nicely framed by vegetation and the right-hand cliff wall. From the switchbacks that follow, the view east is consumed by a sheer wall of nicely cross-bedded Navajo Sandstone. The next flat is richly endowed with thick biological soil crust that brightens with blossoms as early as late March. In this section, please keep on the trail. Cryptobiotic soil is incredibly fragile, and the damage caused by single footprints can take decades to heal. \r\n\nThe fourth flat ends in a short slickrock grade marked by several cairns. Here the Navajo sandstone wall off to the right bears a shallow dome-shaped amphitheater. The acoustics are such that even moderately heavy footfalls can be heard echoing back from the wall, and normal conversation bounces back without significant loss of volume. The wall, appropriately, is known as the \"echo wall.\"\r\n\nA short way beyond the echo wall, the trail leaves the lee of the cliffs on the right and ascends a small hill topped by a sign that states succinctly \u201cTrail\u2019s End.\u201d From this vantage point, the Golden Throne thrusts up high in the northeast, though some of its base is obscured. To the east, the Henry Mountains are visible through a gap, and in springtime they will often be snow-covered and handsome.\r\n\nHiking time to the Golden Throne will be relatively short, and this is a great route if you're limited on time but want to take in some of the highlights of Capitol Reef.

This side trip is worth the effort, and you'll enjoy the up close views of the winding curves of Capitol Reef sandstone. The slot can be negotiated for 500 feet before it ends at an impassable pour-off above a pool and mudhole. At this point, the safest retreat to the main wash is to simply return the way you came. On your way back to the main route, you'll bypass an optional detour on the northern side that has recently been made dangerous by flood damage.\r\n\nOnce you've made your way back to the main wash, you'll continue for about another 3 miles to the wash's end. Be aware that at the end of your journey, the Fremont River must be forded, a task that is usually easy but can be dangerous during times of high water. The best crossing is usually found near a low cliff on the right of the wash, along a path through dense stream-side willows. Cross the river to a sandbar and the easy egress on the opposite side.

Parts of the loop are very rough and rocky, more so than any other front country trail. Despite this, the trail offers plenty of solitude for those who want to avoid the crowds.\r\n\nImmediately from the parking area, the trail drops into and across a wash. On the other side a steady climb leads up through the Moenkopi Formation. A half-mile of steady climbing gains a slight break in the slope after two sets of steps. This is a good place to pause and turn around to take in the emerging view of the Henry Mountains over Capitol Gorge.\r\n\nA short distance later, the loop portion of the the hike begins to the left. If the viewpoint is your goal, simply continue straight ahead up the slope, but if completing the loop, it is best to follow the arrow left.\r\n\nThe tread of the trail gets significantly rougher after the junction and the climbs continue in earnest. A half mile from the start of the loop, the trail nears the rim of Capitol Gorge. Nestled in the distant formations below is Capitol Reef\u2019s oldest rock layer, the White Rim Sandstone. Back to the east, the view has improved and now sweeps farther to the north.\r\n\nA third of a mile farther on, the path makes a gentle turn to the north and the climbing is done. The 1,100 foot elevation gain over the last 1.7 miles is certainly a good workout. After leaving the canyon rim, it is only a little ways further to a right turn onto a downhill section of the Old Wagon Trail.\r\n\nThe route follows the old road down, then turns left. Continue on, and soon a sign indicates the spur trail to the viewpoint (straight ahead) and the return to the trailhead to the right. The short climb up the rocks to the viewpoint is well worth the effort. \r\n\nFrom the spur trail junction, the main loop trail proceeds south, following the contours of the landscape for a short distance, and then trends more to the east as it works down the slope. Happily, the rocks are largely left behind, and the tread is smooth enough that travel is pleasant. All the way back down to the trailhead, the broad views to the east are wonderful.\r\n\nThis content was contributed by author Rick Stinchfield.

The perennial stream must be crossed many times \u2014 usually by hopping from rock to rock. The route also traverses long sandy benches and navigates through vegetation at water's edge. An optional diversion to a good slot canyon is detailed below.\r\n\nThe trail heads northeast, away from the parking area and runs through a transition zone above the creek. At one third-of-a-mile, it drops toward the stream for the first crossing. As with many of the crossings, determining the best rocks to use while hopping across the stream may require a little study. A less obvious path heads up the flat ledge on the other side to join an old road. Ahead, a dense stand of big sage appears right before the trail rounds a point around the southern wall.\r\n\nThe second stream crossing leads to a long sandy bench that can be a spectacular flower garden during a wet spring. After this pleasant stroll, the crossings occur more frequently, and some routes are easier and more obvious than others. While there are a couple of spots where low water levels or recent deposition may change the number of crossings, usually there will be 16 required to get to the east park boundary.\r\n\nAt the sixth crossing, a huge Navajo dome patterned with heavily eroded fractures looms on the right side of the canyon. The canyon becomes less wide at the next ford, and after two more crossings, Pleasant Creek runs through an interesting sluice in the bedrock.\r\n\nAround the 2.4 mile mark the sheer wall on the south side ends, and a large sand flat extends further south. A nice optional diversion is possible if you re-cross the creek to the right and follow a visible hiker-made path to a wash leading from an opening in the Navajo Sandstone. This part of the canyon has a couple of good slot sections for hikers to explore before turning around at a large chockstone near the end of the slot. Several obstacles are present and pools of water can be found during wet times.\r\n\nBack on the main trail; two more crossings proceed a climb up a sandy slope to a gap in the neck of a tight meander. The trail quickly descends back to the creek from there. The canyon walls begin to lower after this point, and the stream follows a more direct path. The trail comes to an end at a fence that crosses the creek near the east boundary of the park. From this point, retrace your steps 3.8 miles back to the parking area.\r\n\nThis content was contributed by author Rick Stinchfield.

On the approach to the fabled Goosenecks, a narrow section of slot canyon along the route, hikers are often dissuaded. However, do not fear! While the canyon constricts quickly into several sets of photogenic narrows and small falls, the hiking remains easy to moderate throughout. Conditions can change dramatically in this section with each flood, but some obstacles are always present. A final low waterfall can present a difficult challenge, especially if it empties into a large pool. After traversing the Goosenecks, the canyon widens for the last half mile to the visitor center. \r\n\nSulphur Creek is a perennial stream, but its volume depends significantly on irrigation operations near Torrey. The flow is often low enough that boots can be worn for much of the hike unless recent flooding has developed pools in the narrows. The temptation is high in the summer to hike in sandals or water shoes, but the three significant obstacles along the route are more safely negotiated with sturdier footwear.\r\n\nThis content was contributed by author Rick Stinchfield.

Mapped here, the trail leaves from the parking area via a short jaunt on the Halls Creek Drainage. \r\n\nAfter a short warm up, this trail will begin to climb a steep fin of Navajo sandstone. While the tread is mostly good, some visitors may be unsettled by the level of exposure apparent on the ascent. Use caution, but know that the next half mile will be the most difficult portion of the journey, and that the rest of the trail is fairly relaxed. \r\n\nAs you continue up the first fin, you\u2019ll eventually reach the top. From there, the exposure is significantly less, and you\u2019ll get a respite from the steady incline. You\u2019ll continue moving over the slick rock of the Navajo formation, following regularly spaced cairns that will mark your way. Have no fear when the trail turns to the north, as you\u2019ll avoid a second fin of sandstone before continuing on. \r\n\nSoon after passing this second fin, some visitors may be relieved to find themselves at the end of the slick rock and back in a sandy wash. You\u2019ll enjoy rolling terrain from this point to the trail\u2019s end, so be sure to look up and around you once in a while. The route passes through an area rich in fish-hook cacti, and you\u2019ll also see plenty of prickly pear cacti. \r\n\nContinue along the sandy wash until nearing the end of the Lower Muley Canyon. This last portion of trail will offer you a bit of thrill as a parting gift, and there will be a bit of exposure, and some steeper slopes just before the trail comes to an end. \r\n\nThis content was contributed by author Rick Stinchfield.

If choosing the latter, the hike is best as an overnight trip (backcountry permits are required for all overnight trips and can be obtained at the visitor center) or to turn around before the Post Cutoff Trail.\r\n\nFrom the trailhead off of Burr Trail Road there are two ways to access this trail. The first is a short but steep slickrock slope connecting to the wash below. The second, less steep option, is to head west along the road for a few hundred feet to the mouth of the wash. The way into the canyon proceeds pleasantly as the wash snakes through the path cut into the Wingate. Several sections of sluice are passed as well as a number of open benches providing good habitat for flowers and shrubs.\r\n\nAround two miles in, a fine section of short narrows is reached. As the narrows makes its sweeping turn, an interesting dissected pothole can be observed. On the other side of the narrows, a large tributary comes in from the west. This is a good spot to turn around if doing an out-and-back. Continuing to the intersection with the Post Cutoff Trail, the wash passes an assortment of benches and trees, minor undercuts, and varnished walls. This section may have water during, and just after, wet periods.\r\n\nA section of less-noteworthy canyon follows the cutoff, but things begin to ramp up with beautiful formations and undercuts. Eventually, the canyon walls tower a thousand feet above. At one point, several huge boulders have fallen into the wash, creating a minor obstacle. The easiest route through the rock pile is to stay left of the the first big rock, and climb down over the log through the triangular opening.\r\n\nAhead, one of the hike's main attractions appears: Cowboy Cave, an enormous undercut with a sandy bench. The natural hedge of boxelder and Gambel oak that borders the alcove adds to its sanctuary-like appeal. From there, the canyon continues as impressively deep narrows as the drainage slices through the Navajo before reaching the mouth of the canyon and the end of the trail.\r\n\nTwo trails intersect at the canyon\u2019s mouth, the Halls Creek Drainage Trail which heads north to the Post Trailhead, and the Muley Tanks and Hamburger Rocks Spur which is a worthwhile detour to some unique geology and the area\u2019s only reliable source of water (requires treatment).\r\n\nThis content was contributed by author Rick Stinchfield.

A little ways ahead, the canyon begins a series of curves and becomes very deep. The walls rise hundreds of feet above and are decorated with dramatic desert varnish. A recent rockfall has dropped a pretty banded sandstone into the wash just after the bends in the canyon start. A small pour-off and rock jam are easily passed.\r\n\nThe canyon remains impressive and easy to navigate up to an undercut and chockstone.

To the north, the wash is usually dry, but rain or melting snow can create all kinds of pools and mudholes that can add considerably to the hiking time.\r\n\nContinuing along the wash, a short section of low-angle sluice adds aesthetic punch with almost every step.

Its beautiful scenery, compacted into a short, 1.4-mile canyon, leaves all who enter its broad canyon walls both inspired and humbled by their natural surroundings. Not to mention, the canyon happens to have been cut perpendicular to the rock layers in this area, providing visitors with a first-hand experience with the vibrant sedimentary rocks that make Capitol Reef famous. \r\n\nStarting where the Red Canyon Trail ends at the wash, the thin red beds of the Carmel Formation rise steeply on the south side as the drainage cuts across them. Shortly, the tan sandstone of the Page is followed by the slightly whiter Navajo, as the wash turns north about a tenth of a mile from the start. To the right, a steep slope of Navajo is topped by the nearly indistinguishable Page and capped by the much more obvious yellow Carmel. After a pleasant and well vegetated stretch, the wash again cuts through the Navajo to the west. A series of finely grouped perpendicular cracks are displayed on a slope on the right side of the wash. Exfoliation of thin layers of sandstone is occurring here, exposing solid, uncracked rock. The wash meanders to the south, before bending to the west and entering the Kayenta Formation with its alternating light-colored sandstones and red shales. At about the 2-mile mark, the solid red Wingate Sandstone makes its appearance. Interesting rock layers at this location are evidence of its origin as dune sand.\r\n\nGiven the steep angle of the Wingate, it only takes another 3 or 4 minutes to hike right through its 350-foot thickness, emerging into the soft blue-gray and lavender Chinle Formation. The wash narrows and becomes wet, and reeds and tamarisk begin to appear. This is a good place to turn around, but the wash does continue. Before returning to the trailhead, note the Wingate to the west and how much higher it is than at the outcrop just to the north (right), indicating the true scale and form of the Waterpocket Fold. So is the power of erosion, since all the formations the route travels past were once in place here above the Chinle and have been removed, probably in only 10 to 20 million years. In hiking back from the Chinle and looking across the Notom-Bullfrog Road to the east, almost the entire span of dinosaur history is laid out in the space of just four miles.\r\n\nThis content was contributed by author Rick Stinchfield.

The way is sandy and easy going, likely making it the most accessible slot canyon in the park.\r\n\nBeyond the slot, the canyon remains highly scenic as the walls soar far overhead in vertical sweeps, often adorned with veils of desert varnish.

(This is not the same as the Shafer Canyon Road which you'll pass before the Visitor Center.) An entrance fee or National Park's pass is required for entry. \r\n\nThe trail begins at the southwest corner of the parking lot at the trail information sign. The description and elevation profile provided here assume the loop is taken in the counter clockwise direction, heading west (right) out of the parking lot.  \r\n\nThe trail begins by crossing the road and quickly dropping onto a lower bench. For the next 3 miles, it weaves in and out of small drainages below large white and red sandstone alcoves. There are occasional views into a deep red-walled canyon below and continual views of sandstone spires and canyons in the distance. Watch for evidence of historic ranching along the way. The trail is mostly packed dirt, with some loose sand and rocks to navigate. While there is no significant elevation gain or loss, the trail continuously rolls up and down, in and out of the drainages. The trail is easy to follow and is marked by small rock cairns (piles of neatly stacked rocks).\r\n\nAt mile 3.3, the trail quickly climbs out of the canyon and onto the mesa top. This section requires working your way up a sandstone slope and it is not possible to take this portion quickly due to the pitch and loose sand and rocks. The climb is only about 0.1 miles long and is not exposed.\r\n\nThe remainder of the trail heads back the same direction you came, but at a higher elevation, allowing you to look down into the canyons that you initially traversed. This section of trail is relatively flat and alternates between large sandstone slabs and loose sand. At mile 5.3, the trail comes to a fenced overlook with spectacular views down into expansive canyons with the La Sal Mountains in the distance. Be sure to watch for jeeps or mountain bikes making their way down the steep switchbacks of the Shafer Canyon Road below.  \r\n\nAt this point, work your way along the road, careful to watch for traffic, until you cross the \"neck\" - a 40 foot wide isthmus that connects the Island in the Sky Mesa to the northern mesa - and then find the trail again on the right hand side. Red cliff walls drop down almost vertically on both sides of the neck providing spectacular views.

Where headway seemed impossible at every turn, the route somehow threaded through the terrain with seamless ease. Leveling briefly on an exposed ledge perched alongside the mesa, the Buttes of the Cross slip into view. When seen from the northeast, the moniker manifests when together these two landmarks form a cross.

The Druid Arch trail heads south, continuing in Elephant Canyon. For the first one and a quarter miles, the trail follows the canyon bottom along a mix of sand, rock, and loose gravel, which makes for easy going. \r\n\nAfter the 1.25 miles, you'll need to keep an eye out for when the trail abruptly leaves the bottom of the wash on the left (east). Despite the large number of cairns marking this departure from the wash, it is still super easy to miss as it looks like a drainage. If you do miss it, no big deal - you'll soon realize what you've done when the trail disappears into thick brush and a small pool.\r\n\nThis also is where the trail will begin to gain more elevation and require scrambling. Head up and out of the wash, and over a ~10 foot scramble. It's really not too difficult and I'd say adds to the interactive-fun of the outing (there are many such scrambles in Needles). A little more elevation and you'll be on a ledge that follows parallel to the canyon bottom. Continue heading south on this flat section, which can become narrow but never so narrow as to feel exposed. You'll also see the dry falls that are why you needed to exit the bottom of the wash. \r\n\nYou'll come to a spot where the canyon turns more to the east and here the trail rejoins the canyon bottom. Head up this wash. Basically continue along the wash bottom - it's relatively easy going but there will be a few mini-scrambles - as it bends around to head south again. You'll come to a section of the wash that is quite steep, but navigable. The sandstone offers good traction when dry, but could pose problems if wet! (On the return we kind of had to sit and slide back down). \r\n\nAfter the steep wash, keep an eye out for where the trail heads east and leaves the wash again. This time is not so difficult to see. You're basically at the bottom of Druid Arch now, but won't be able to see it yet. There is some semi-exposed scrambling you'll have to do to get over some large rocks. A metal bar is bolted to one to offer you a place to put your feet. Some people will be uncomfortable with this section, so be sure to know your limits and turn back if necessary. \r\n\nContinuing on, you'll head into a gap between canyon walls and come to one of the steepest parts: a rockfall that will require a little more scrambling. At the top - Druid Arch! One of the more magnificent and less-visited arches in the area. \r\n\nIt is easier navigation on the way out, but some people don't drop into the wash soon enough and reach a dead end.

By foot or wheel, follow this busy 3.7-mile road to where it ends at Devils Lane Road.\r\n\nMillions upon millions of years ago, as sea levels in the area dropped, a thick layer of sandstone covered the evaporated salt left behind. As red sand and silt were deposited by rain and snowmelt, white sand also blew in, forming dunes. These geologic processes are still on display today in the alternating bands of red and white rock throughout Canyonlands, and especially in the Needles.\r\n\nDuring a period of tectonic unrest, these evaporated salt layers were pulled towards the Colorado River, causing valleys (known as grabens) to collapse. From the 4x4 road, the Lower Red Lake Canyon Trail leaves the Devil's Lane graben to transect a horst - a raised fault block thrown upwards between two grabens. \r\n\nWith a bit of easy scrambling, the trail reaches a high point on the horst. From here, views of the Devil's Lane graben widen below you. Turning west, the route drops down into a sunken wash and winds toward the western edge of the horst, where soon you'll be able to see the length of the Cyclone Canyon graben. Quickly loosing 250 feet, the trail meets with the Cyclone Canyon Trail. \r\n\nEntering one last horst, the trail funnels into Lower Red Lake Canyon. The name\u2014Red Lake\u2014could in part lend itself to the red sandstone, but it\u2019s a misleading title as I saw no lake in sight whatsoever. \r\n\nScrambling onto the sidewall of the deep gorge first, a well-maintained trail threads the rugged terrain to bypass an impassable pour-off, then descends slowly into the sandy wash. The grade abates, and the trail marches steadily downhill toward the Colorado River. Dwarfed by the towering walls, the wide vistas of the Needles disappear, and the first glimpse at the water doesn\u2019t come until the wash empties at the shoreline. \r\n\nAcross the river, you might notice a flat, sandy plain, seemingly out of place among the sheer cliffs surrounding much of the rest of Cataract Canyon.

The preferred mode of attack is to hike north to south and arrange for someone to pick you up at the end of this trail; doing it as an out-and-back is for the masochistic.  This braided, barely maintained trail travels though a wide canyon formed by a creek.  Some users ignore the trail and wade through the water simply to stay cool and because in many places the creek bed is more firm than the sandy trail.  Water shoes, sandals or old mesh sneakers make this option most pleasant.  \r\n\nThe beginning of this trail starts on the east side of the main park road, just to the north of the Courthouse Wash Bridge (4.5 miles from the Park Entrance).  There is a parking pullout on the west side of the road across from the trail.  Many folks opt for a mellow 1/4 mile amble down into the wash to visit the first of many swimming holes, then turn around for a 1/2 mile total trip.  \r\n\nTo explore more, keep descending and after a mile consider a visit the first of four eastern side canyons that drain the Petrified Dunes (the first sidecanyon is the shortest, the second sidecanyon is the longest).  If you're pressed for time, it is OK to skip the sidecanyons, just getting to the end of the Upper Courthouse Wash trail is workout enough for most people.  Keep going south down the wash and eventually reach the junction with Courthouse Wash Rock Art Trail.  This detour visits some impressive petroglyphs but adds another mile to your day.  Immediately after this junction, you are returned to reality in the form of rushing traffic on Highway 191.  The best parking for the southern end of this trail is the large lot just to the east of the trail's end off Highway 191.  \r\n\nSome words to the wise: take at least 2 quarts (2 liters) of water per person, wear a hat, use sunscreen, take breaks.

If you still feel energetic and successfully conquered the challenges of the Main Trail with aplomb, then you'll likely find the Primitive Loop to be similarly enjoyable.  \r\n\nFrom the 3-way junction with Devils Garden Main Trail and the Dark Angel Trail, the Devils Garden Primitive Loop Trail begins with a moderately steep descent of Fin Canyon.  About halfway down, and about 0.4 miles from the beginning of the loop, look for the Private Arch Trail on the right (leading south/southeast).  This worthwhile detour is easy and visits an infrequently seen, isolated arch.    \r\n\nOnce back on the Devils Garden Primitive Loop Trail, continue downhill over rock spines, through sandy washes and slickrock sections, threading between mesmerizing fin canyons.  Some parts in this area become treacherous when the rock is wet or snowy.  There is one rock face that must be navigated via a ledge and another tricky spot where a depression often fills with water and must be circumnavigated.  Most hikers with grippy shoes report excitement without dunkings.  (If you are concerned about these obstacles, you can visit Private Arch and then retrace your steps back to the Devils Garden Main Trail.)\r\n\nThe remainder of the trail covers more open ground, ascending gradually to the junction with the Devils Garden Main Trail at the Landscape Arch area.

These are short, easy detours and highly recommended.  \r\n\nReturn to the Devils Garden Main Trail, heading northwest through more widely spaced rock fin valleys.

From here, take the paved path to Landscape Arch Trail and its spectacular viewpoint (more details about this impressive arch can be found on the Landscape Arch Trail trail page).  The part of the trail to Landscape arch is non-taxing and very family-friendly, but past this point be advised to keep kids under close supervision.\r\n\nBack on the Devils Garden Main Trail, expect increased challenges as your route climbs over sandstone slabs and traverses narrow ledges with some exposure to heights.  Follow rock pile cairns to stay on the correct route.  Soon, you have the option to take the short spurs  Partition Arch Trail and Navajo Arch Trail to the southwest.  \r\n\nThese arches often have shade and make worthwhile detours, but if you're out of stamina or time it is OK to bypass them.  Further along the undulating Devils Garden Main Trail, cross more fins hiking over exposed, sun-baked ground.

The trail soon leaves the spring, however, and starts to ascend steeply through the forest. After about 0.75 miles, the grade lessens slightly as the trail travels through a nice meadow, but then steepens again as it leaves the meadow. After about 1.5 miles, the trail passes the remains of an old cabin, and then ascends through a meadow to a couple of trail junctions between 1.8-2 miles. The Box Elder Trail continues to the left (west and south) at both of these junctions, as the trail starts to circumnavigate Box Elder Peak. \r\n\nDuring this stretch between miles 2 and 3, the grade flattens out a little bit, but the trail still undulates as it goes in and out of drainages and avalanche paths. The trail in this section can often be very narrow and rocky, and in some places can be a little bit hard to find. However, the scenery is spectacular, and the terrain is rugged, which makes it a really fun place to hike and explore. After about 3 miles, the trail starts to ascend through a beautiful meadow up to a pass on the southeast flank of South Box Elder peak. \r\n\nAfter hitting this pass, the trail drops down slightly and passes through a large rock garden and then starts to ascend again, on an increasingly narrow trail along the southern slopes of South Box Elder. This is a really cool part, with great views of Utah Valley, and great views down the avalanche paths on the south side of Box Elder Peak. After traversing this side of Box Elder, the trail ascends to another small pass at around mile 4. This pass is the high point of the trail, at around 9,900 feet above sea level. \r\n\nAfter hitting this pass, the trail turns into mostly downhill and flat terrain as it continues to traverse the flanks of Box Elder peak. This is a really fun section beyond the pass, because the terrain becomes largely more manageable, and passes through large meadows, with great views of Box Elder and the surrounding peaks. At around mile 5, there is a trail junction with the Box Elder Summit Trail that is easy to miss because it heads back to the southeast. About 0.25 miles after this trail junction, there is another junction with the Phelps Canyon Trail. Continue to the right to stay on the Box Elder Trail. The trail then continues along the western side of Box Elder, slowly descending until the last 0.75 miles, where it drops steeply to meet up with the Deer Creek-Dry Creek Trail #043.", "features": "Fall Colors \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7038065/view-to-the-west-at-the-southern-end-of-white-canyon-trail", "ratings": {"rating": 4.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 7.7, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [9873, 6790], "alt-change": [3385, 1854], "avg-grade": 13.0, "max-grade": 43.0}},

It's not too difficult, but the deep sand makes the miles feel long. This trail is very popular with Jeeps, so avoid Jeep Jamboree weekends especially (weekdays are pretty empty). However, there's a lot of fun slickrock, and the scenery is just incredible.\r\n\nFrom the parking lot (first take a look at the dinosaur tracks on the east end), start up the dirt road, which is impassible for normal cars but popular with Jeeps. It's not overly steep or technical, though near the top there's a short section with lots of large, loose rocks.\r\n\nOnce you reach the plateau in about two miles, the trail becomes much less steep but there are now many ledges and long sandy spots over the next mile.  The edge of the trail, the path continues to widen, and is over 50' wide in places!\r\n\nAfter the sand pits, the slickrock fun begins.  You hike and up and down many domes, generally trending uphill.  There are several ledges that are high steps down.  After about 3.5 miles, you are now high on the plateau and the scenery gets awesome.  Rock fin formations, the city of Moab, and the La Sal mountains spread out before you.\r\n\nAt mile 5.5 there is a 100 yard trail to view \"Little Arch\".  This is a popular place to turn around if you're getting tired, though the trail is actually better from here to the end, so stick with it if you have the energy!\r\n\nWhen you hit the fork in the road that says \"PS\" and has arrows pointing in both directions, go RIGHT.  The left option is for Jeeps doing a loop.\r\n\nThe final couple of miles have quite a bit of climbing up steep slickrock.  It's amazing what you can stick to though; you'll be on top soon.  It's a really fun section.\r\n\nAt trail's end, you hit the Portal trail at the edge of the plateau.  You now have three options:\r\nTurn around and return the way you came (which is how this trail is mapped).Turn left and loop around the Golden Spike, which reunites with Poison Spider about halfway back.Turn right and descend the treacherous Portal trail.

The route for Longbow Trail is marked with green blazes however many variations exist up the initial slope with variable footing depending on the route you take, sometimes exposed or slick with sand. Take time to explore this area and you'll encounter both dinosaur tracks and petroglyphs. \r\n\nThe trail continues upward a short ways before funneling into a steep narrow slot at which point several metal rungs have been installed in the rock to aid your ascent. After the short climb up the rungs the trail continues up a few more rocky steps before leveling out. \r\n\nFollow the trail across sandy flats and slickrock mounds taking note of blazes painted on the rock. The trail eventually enters a gully and Longbow Arch comes into view. Scramble up the gully and enjoy the serenity of this hidden gem.

At this point, where the trail goes up onto the paved road, stay to the left on the paved portion, but then after that take your first right onto the dirt road that goes past a power plant and associated structures built on the creek.

Parking at the fork is the best choice for low-clearance vehicles, as the road ahead can be littered with medium-to-large ruts oriented in such a way that even staying high with your tires, you can inadvertently slip down in. For those with higher clearance, don't be discouraged. Even after some of the worst rain this area saw during the fall of 2016, this section of road was easily tackled by a stock Toyota Tacoma with bald all-season tires (or \"racing slicks\" as their owner affectionately called them). If you can make it up the road, simply park off to the side at the first fork you come to.\r\n\nStarting at this point, follow the road to the left as it climbs steadily through rolling terrain, intermittently slogging up short but hellaciously steep grades clad with softball-sized loose rocks. After a few miles of this, the trail reaches a wooden hitching post and a brown wooden sign noting the trail direction. Follow the sign's instructions and climb yet another rutted, loose, ridiculously un-fun climb up a red dirt section of road. However, don't fear, as the climb is relatively short, and upon reaching the top, it rewards you with nice views of the surrounding area, including the swirling white sandstone of Texas Canyon.\r\n\nAt this point, the trail makes its way through a narrow bit of cliffside singletrack before descending steeply on the other side of the ridge through deciduous forest.

The 1.2 miles to where the canyon narrows isn\u2019t particularly scenic, but the distance passes quickly.\r\n\nAs the route enters the Carmel Formation, the walls rise above and the route becomes interesting and far more strenuous. Two faint trails can aide in the early going, especially the second one which follows a sandy climb out of the wash to bypass the boulders below - a welcome option on the return. If you choose to skip the bypass, the boulders in the wash make a fun warmup for the day. The bypass returns to the wash via a slickrock ramp above a scaleable dryfall.\r\n\nA second fluted bedrock slope signals a nice serpentine narrows with walls about 8 feet apart. Shortly after the narrows, the canyon divides into two quite similar branches, with Cottonwood Wash going right and immediately tightening. A thinner narrows follows shortly with a difficult slot section right behind. A chockstone boulder here may require help to pass.\r\n\nThere\u2019s little easy trail before a skinny, awkward slot with another chockstone. Up next, a huge arrow-shaped boulder blocks the way. Surprisingly, a route goes under the arrow along the right wall, continues under a smaller boulder wedged against the bigger one, and then through a small opening above. Remember this ascent because the return is almost blind.\r\n\nAfter conquering the arrow, it\u2019s disappointing to find a long, imposing pool filling an otherwise enticing slot. The pool can be very deep, frigidly cold, and generally unappealing. The difficult chockstone at the end should only be attempted by experienced canyoneers if water is present. This becomes the turn around point for most groups.\r\n\nRarely, the pool is dry. If this happens, the chockstone can be passed with a difficult climb from underneath. From this point the route is interesting and relentlessly challenging. A particularly smooth boulder ahead is difficult going for those less than six feet tall. The boulder is best passed by spanning the walls to slither over.\r\n\nJust beyond is an intriguing pothole with a curving, scaleable entry chute. The reward for this scramble is a long, slanted, narrow slot that may be the best section of the rout. After a pleasant wide, opening in the canyon the home stretch appears. This long section of deep narrows is frequently filled with water. If dry, continue to the 10-foot high dryfall which is the logical turnaround.\r\n\nThis content was contributed by author Rick Stinchfield.

The first 1.25 miles to a canyon junction (stay right or west) is open and flat, with scattered cottonwoods and tamarisk. The canyon then tightens to a good narrows section that includes a short, shallow, and sinuous slot with minor chockstones. About 2.25 miles from the road, visitors will encounter a good 500-foot long slot that eventually ends at angled walls.\r\n\nUntil it is rearranged by the next big flood, Sheets Gulch is easy going, with alternating stretches of narrows and slightly wider, but still deep and impressive gorges. At places, the Navajo is eroded into steep, sweeping slopes. Exposed pieces of black petrified wood from the Chinle Formation are increasingly common farther up Sheets Gulch. The slots are generally a little less impressive after the initial group, but are still interesting, with enough chockstones blocking the path to provide some upper body exercise.\r\n\nAt the 4.5-mile mark, an easy 8-foot high boulder is, as of this writing, a minor obstacle. A third of a mile beyond, the character of Sheets Gulch changes quite dramatically.

Negotiating the canyon can be difficult at times, and you'll need to scramble across boulders in the slot sections of Little Death Hollow. \r\n\nThe first 3 miles of the trail are a very easy hike on a fairly well-defined trail that crosses the Death Hollow wash a number of times. You generally follow a straight line towards the mouth of the canyon with the Little Bown Bench on your right and the Big Bown Bench on your left. There is an interesting large boulder on your right about 1.5 miles from the trailhead that has a petroglyph panel of, most likely, bighorn sheep at the bottom. As you continue into Little Death Hollow, the trail crosses the wash a number of times, but is not always easily recognizable. You can stay in the wash if that's easier since the trail will eventually also drop into the wash.\r\n\nYou come across an impressive forming arch in the western canyon wall at about 2.3 miles. A side canyon will enter from the left at 3.2 miles; keep right. The canyon gets more and more scenic after that. The first narrow section starts at 4 miles, but is easy to navigate. The canyon widens again shortly after half a mile. Several large boulders will be in your way and will require careful scrambling. A very fine stretch of narrows is at about 5.2 miles where the walls are at times barely shoulder wide, and you need to squeeze through. Probably the best slot section is at about 6 miles in, and it actually lasts for almost a mile with brief interruptions. Depending on the last storm, getting through this part of the route will take much longer than you anticipate because you'll need to climb over and under a large number of obstacles stuck in the slots. Especially backpackers might have a difficult time with their packs. But the effort is more than worth it\u2014these slot sections certainly stand out in Utah. \r\n\nThe canyon widens quickly after 7 miles as you approach the confluence of Little Death Hollow and Horse Canyon. Cottonwood trees line either side of the canyon. The confluence is a good place for a lunch break. You can either retrace your steps or continue on to Wolverine Creek Trail.

Follow the narrow singletrack across a creek crossing as it angles up the barren slope en route to a nearby saddle. If the trail fizzles out before you reach the saddle, simply head right and keep climbing until you reach the clearly defined Skyline Trail (015). The view along this section is superb, so make sure to spin around a few times.\r\n\nAlmost immediately, the trail separates at the edge of the saddle. Head for a wide gap in the vegetation that leads to the rounded ridgeline to your left, then turn to the right and keep climbing. After a half mile, the trail drops down the other side of the ridge and begins the long descent.\r\n\nOver the next two miles, the descent drops through the forest, briefly follows the edge of a ridgeline, and enters a large meadow. Head diagonally right through the grass to momentarily overlap with the Blue Creek-Tuerto Trail (014) before they separate next to two old buildings. Head to the left for more steady descending.\r\n\nAs you approach a reservoir, plenty of trail braiding obscures the main route. Fortunately, it doesn't matter too much, just pick up the trail in the small valley just past the reservoir. The trail remains pretty clear from here to its end in a junction with the Tuerto Trail (011).", "features": "Fall Colors \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "ratings": {"rating": 2.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 7.5, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [10438, 7753], "alt-change": [1980, 2685], "avg-grade": 12.0, "max-grade": 45.0}},

This slope is very rocky and the soil underneath the rocks is slippery clay, so watch your footing if there has been any recent rain.\r\n\nFrom the top of this ridge, the climb mellows out, and the trail starts to wind through scrub oak tunnels and small groves of aspen.

Down below are many houses and a kiva that you can explore. The highlight here is a set of sticks that have stood for nearly 1,000 years and appears to be a pen to hold turkeys. Excellent petroglyphs line the wall.\r\n\nAt 7.2 miles, Todie Canyon comes in on the left.

Superior Trail can be taken to Mount Superior and Monte Cristo, two great peaks along the Cottonwood Ridgeline. \r\n\nAnother option from Cardiff Pass is to cross over the ridge and descend down into Mill D South. This is a similarly steep and rocky trail, but appears to be less frequently used as the trail can be hard to follow at times. However, the views all around in this beautiful canyon make up for the confusion. The trail generally trends to the west and above the natural drainage in the canyon but crosses a few of the ephemeral streams on its way down. \r\n\nAbout 3/4 of a mile down, the trail descends down close to the main drainage and follows it for a short distance until it meets up with an old mining road and then follows that road down until it passes by an old mining site and meets up with the main Mill D South Fork Road.", "features": "Views", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7084278/summer-wildflowers-mid-july-to-late-july-at-cardiff-pass-alta-utah", "ratings": {"rating": 3.8, "num_reviewers": 5}, "stats": {"dist": 2.2, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [9968, 8771], "alt-change": [1197, 973], "avg-grade": 19.0, "max-grade": 49.0}},

It makes a couple of switchbacks, but then starts heading generally northeast, in the direction of Twin Lakes Pass. \r\n\nThe road is pretty wide and easily followed, with a steady amount of elevation gain along the entire profile. About 0.75 miles in, there is a locked gate meant to keep vehicles from traveling along the road, but it's open for pedestrians to travel around. \r\n\nSome of the points of interest start about 1 mile in when the road crosses through a portion of old mine tailings. Shortly thereafter, the trail takes a right turn to the southeast, right at the base of a large series of mine tailings piles. After going to the southeast, the trail goes through a nice meadow, then starts to ascend a little steep, rocky section where you pass by an abandoned mine tunnel that's right by the trail, and then you get out into some beautiful meadows below Twin Lakes Pass. \r\n\nAbout 1.5 miles in, a fork in the road takes one trail to the north toward Silver Fork while the Twin Lakes Pass Trail branches off, turns into singletrack, and heads east, toward Twin Lakes Pass. This portion of the trail after the junction ascends through some beautiful alpine meadows, small stands of sparse pine trees, and eventually arrives at Twin Lakes Pass. From the pass, there are great views of the Wasatch Crest, Twin Lakes Reservoir below, and parts of Brighton ski area. This is an exceptional place to see the sunrise, or even come in the twilight hours.\r\n\nAfter cresting the pass, the trail heads to the left, contouring around the hillside below the Honeycomb Cliffs (be careful here\u2014there is an unmaintained spur trail that heads down towards Twin Lakes Reservoir that looks like the main trail, but actually is not. It descends quickly, then becomes pretty steep and eventually becomes overgrown). This section is pretty fun, as the views are great, the singletrack is generally pretty good (although it is technical in places), and culminates in a steep, rocky, but really short descent by a small rock formation and emerges onto a wide ski run. This ski run is an easy hike, and you stay on it for about a quarter of a mile, and it turns to the right and starts descending towards Twin Lakes dam. The ski run soon turns into some nice singletrack, then ends too quickly at the top of the dam.

The canyon is wide enough that it allows plenty of sunlight while often avoiding direct sunlight.\r\n\nThe trail is not marked but it is easy to follow and there is nowhere to get lost except up the occasional side canyon. There are dozen of river crossing so be prepared to get wet up to your knees. I did okay with the combination of waterproof hiking boot and waterproof knee high socks; my companion just wore waterproof toe socks that gave him good traction and didn't hurt his feet because the trail is mostly sand and riverbed rocks are small. Sometimes it is easiest to just navigate in the river, particularly towards the end of the canyon, near the confluence.\r\n\nFlash floods are possible in this area, so this trip should be postponed if rain is likely. However, this is not a slot canyon per se. If you are caught by a flash flood, you should have time to scramble to location two or three meters above the river and set up camp.\r\n\nI suggest wearing a hat, mostly to prevent getting your head scratched by low branches.\r\n\nThis route is almost always done one way and as part of a larger loop. For a fee, you can arrange a shuttle in the town of Escalante, in which you can have your car moved from the start of the Boulder Mail Trail to the junction of the Escalante River and Highway 12.

Compared to the route described by Michael Kelsey in \"Canyon Hiking Guide to the Colorado Plateau\", the route described here is easier, with less elevation change. It starts from a pullout on Hwy 12 about 11.5 miles east of Escalante, Utah where the highway crosses a dry tributary to Phipps Wash. \r\n\nIt is possible to hike fairly directly down the tributary, leaving the creek bed only to get around places where it drops sharply. However, the exceptionally beautiful rock formations just above should not be missed. I recommend taking the slightly longer, scenic route down to Phipps Wash and then returning by the more direct route.\r\n\nFrom Hwy 12, climb down the gently sloping rock to the creek-bed. At about 0.3 miles, there is an easy way to climb the red-rock slopes on the right side to hundreds of yards of undulating rock formations colored with light reds and oranges mixed with the deep green of trees and bushes. This is especially beautiful in the morning sun. These formations seem little known, but they are easily reached and worth a trip by themselves.  \r\n\nExplore the rocks as you head toward the left side of Hill 5840, which consists almost entirely of pink and orange rock. Hike around to the back side of Hill 5840 where there are sweeping views of upper Phipps Basin and easy slopes down to the main Phipps Wash. When you first reach it, the wash has a sharp drop, but this is easily bypassed. A little farther down, you pass the mouth of the tributary that leads back to to Hwy 12. After that, simply follow the canyon all the way down to the Escalante River. \r\n\nThe middle part of Phipps Wash is fairly wide, with orange sandstone walls on both sides. As much as possible, avoid the deep sand in the center by hiking on firmer sand or rocks along the sides.  \r\n\nAt around four miles, you reach a major side canyon on the right (east) side. On the far side of the canyon's mouth, there is a trail marked with cairns that leads up the slick rock to Phipps Arch. This trail has ledges and sections that are very steep, especially near the top.\r\n\nOn the return trip, at the mouth of the tributary leading to Hwy 12, avoid an impassible section just upstream by   scrambling up the far (south) side of the mouth to the top of the canyon. Return to the creek bed where possible.

Climb onto the scaling ledges early on to get to higher ground. Keep right afterwards when a major side canyon opens on the left. The thickets can be nearly impenetrable here.

Make sure that you stick to the main road, as there are many side roads that can be misleading. You'll go through two gates before you reach the final (third) gate, which is the Forest Service gate. This gate has a permanent lock on it and a large parking area in front of it (you could drive up and park here, to avoid hiking up the road with a higher clearance vehicle).\r\n\nFrom the Forest Service gate, you have two options - you can either take the doubletrack trail all the way up, or you can take the singletrack (the option I will describe) that splits off from and eventually crosses the doubletrack several times.\r\n\nAs you start up the trail, you'll get some glimpses of Birch Creek and start to see wildflowers, especially if you go early in the season (May or June). Less than a quarter of a mile up the doubletrack, you'll see a singletrack trail going off to the left - take this trail and you'll avoid the first large crossing of Birch Creek. You'll cut through a meadow that is sparsely populated with trees and eventually drop down to a very small creek crossing. \r\n\nContinuing along the trail, you'll pass through meadows and forested areas with rolling hills and occasional dry stream crossings.

Speaking of the lake, it is a great stopping point for a rest and a picnic.You can easily do that section of the trail with small children, and make East Shingle Creek Lake your destination. \r\n\nIt is nestled beautifully on three sides by a fairly tall incline covered in pine trees.

Down the other side you come to the joining of Erickson Basin Trail and Big Elk Lake Trail. There is a sign, but currently there is a very large pine tree that has fallen in front of the sign, across the joining of the trails.

There is a spring on the north east side of North Erickson Lake, whose water tastes good. I had cell phone service scrambling in a southern direction, across a rock slide on the west side of the mountain overlooking South Erickson Lake. There is a great view from over there, as well, though no official trail to get there.\r\n\nContinuing on Big Elk Lake Trail, you have to follow the cairns marking the trail, as it crosses a lot of large, flat rock beds. The cairns continue the two descents into Big Elk Lake, past three smaller lakes on a smaller ledge of sorts overlooking Big Elk Lake.

I've run and hiked it more times than I can count at all seasons of the year, and it is easily one of my most favorite trails along the Wasatch Front. I get nostalgic just thinking about this place.\r\n\nYou can start this trail in two different places.  For a longer outing, start at the parking that is just up above Farmington Pond (this may be your only option in winter if the canyon road gate is closed).  Follow a network of trails into Farmington Canyon. Don't worry too much about taking the wrong fork at any point. Just follow your nose into the canyon, and you'll eventually find the only trail that takes you furthest inward. This will lead to the switch-back where the canyon road goes from paved to unpaved, at which point there is also a pull-out for parking.  This is the other starting location for the trail, if you'd like to drive into the canyon to get to the more scenic part of the hike sooner.\r\n\nFrom the pull-out at the end of the pavement, the trail follows the north side of the canyon, but stays a fair distance from the creek. Enjoy the flora and fauna the whole way to a fun waterfall! You can hike to the base of it, or to the top of it but use caution. From the waterfall, you can continue further into the canyon a ways until the trail disappears near some old abandoned mining equipment, or you can take the switch-backs up to Sunset Campground. This is a good place to stop and eat/re-hydrate.\r\n\nFrom here, simply return the same way that you came to get back to the trailhead(s) and your vehicle.", "features": "Cave \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Spring \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Waterfall \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "ratings": {"rating": 3.5, "num_reviewers": 4}, "stats": {"dist": 6.1, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [6392, 4234], "alt-change": [2184, 27], "avg-grade": 7.0, "max-grade": 32.0}},
