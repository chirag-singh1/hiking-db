Because of this, only historic route restoration was used as the process for the creation of this trail. Three early 20th Century homesteads created a spiderweb network of paths throughout. Invasive plant species and years of overgrowth were cleared from selected sections of this network to create a cohesive loop that provides a glimpse of every major feature of the wildlife area.\r\n\nAfter turning off of the North Loop, you'll start descending into the valley that bisects the area. Only 50 feet down the trail, you'll pass the end of the loop. Continue straight and, eventually, you'll cross the drainage that is only wet after rains. A bit of flat trail awaits before beginning the climb on the other side. The trail passes through a storage shed's foundation remains of an old farm and provides one of the most technical rock sections of the entire trail.\r\n\nThen the climbing begins. There are a couple very welcome recovery zones on the climb that will eventually lead you to an open area at the top of a hill with a nice view of the valley. At this point, the trail turns north for a gradual descent along the eastern property line. After turning to the west along the northern property line, the trail will pass through an old dumpsite and have some minor elevation changes as you traverse around one of the ridge tops. As you descend into an open grassy area, be prepared for the turn back into the trees. The singletrack in this section becomes very tight but it's, generally, downhill. A couple tight switchbacks lurk here. The trail reaches a more recent historic route before the end of the descent giving one the chance to let off the brakes.\r\n\nAfter crossing another drainage, a short climb brings you near the north property line where you go west briefly. As you notice a few rocks in the trail, slow down for one of the tightest turns. Then, you'll descend to a creek crossing just above a nice waterfall. Days after a good rain will bring out its best.\r\n\nAfter this crossing, the climb on the opposite side, and some very tight bench cut trail, one will reach an incredibly steep section that many have to dismount for. Some flat trail await above this. Then a long gradual climb takes you above the river on the hilltop to the west. Winter provides amazing views.\r\n\nA high speed descent to a step-up is your reward for all the climbing and the sign that the end of the trail is near", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Waterfall \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "ratings": {"rating": 5.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 2.1, "dist-type": "Loop", "alt-range": [1097, 966], "alt-change": [266, 271], "avg-grade": 5.0, "max-grade": 17.0}},

The trail retraces the old path of the Pacific Railroad, the first railroad to head west out of St. Louis. There are restrooms but no running water at the Glencoe trailhead.\r\n\nThe trail heads south to the Meramec River and passes the Wabash Frisco and Pacific Railroad train station. This railroad is open seasonally to the public. Steam locomotives pull passenger cars along the river valley which makes for a great family activity. Going west (right), hikers will experience a nice half-mile of trail. The Hamilton Creek bridge is still held up by the original bridge abutments which were built by the first railroad. The spring-fed Hamilton Creek begins in Rockwood Reservation. \r\n\nThis new portion of trail exists because of a partnership between the City of Wildwood and the Great Rivers Greenway. It passes under old river bluffs and offers quick views of the Meramec River. The trail is planned to extend to the southwest and connect to Route 66 State Park. \r\n\nGoing east along the trail, hikers start towards Castlewood State Park. A large bluff next to the trail is one of the first landmarks encountered. The trail passes the bluff and continues into part of Castlewood State Park. The landscape is representative of the old gravel company which once operated here. This novel environment has fostered the growth of prickly pear cactus which is native to Missouri and is well-adapted for the rocky, dry soils. \r\n\nBeached on the bank of the Meramec is an old tug boat - historic relic of the sand and gravel day. It is difficult to imagine barges running the narrow and sometimes shallow river. The next trailhead is at Sherman Beach County Park. A big gravel bar makes getting to the river simple. \r\n\nA 1-mile loop trail can be accessed via the Stinging Nettle Trail. This gravel trail follows the Meramec before reuniting with the Al Foster. The next junction is with the Cedar Bluff Trail which goes through Castlewood State.", "features": "Fall Colors \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7008831/the-meramec-river-off-the-al-foster-trail", "ratings": {"rating": 4.5, "num_reviewers": 4}, "stats": {"dist": 5.1, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [501, 436], "alt-change": [273, 228], "avg-grade": 2.0, "max-grade": 9.0}},

At the fields, the trail will branch, with the right fork leading to the Meadows Loop trail and the left branch continuing on the Lakeview Trail. \n\nDuring migration seasons of spring and fall, many water fowl such as ducks make a pit stop at Creve Coeur park on their long journeys. Stop on your way around the park to observe the ducks on your way around the lake. \n\nContinuing on, visitors will descend a small hill, and moves into a wooded area. This area was once an island in the lake that was created from a 1980s dredging of lake. For a while after, the trail will parallel the Creve Coeur Creek, and will take multiple sharp turns passing under Page Avenue. Keep an eye out here, as the wetlands are often filled with seasonal water fowl. \n\nAt Dripping Springs, the trail emerges from the woods into an open vista. Visitors enjoy beautiful views of the lake and the waterfall, both of which are immortalized in Native American legend. The rest of the return journey to Sailboat Cove will continue to follow the lake, and remain in the open.

Planted with native grasses and wildflowers, this area is another must stop for birders. With 100 acres of natural habitat, this is a good place to spot the occasional Northern Harrier and other native avian species. Spring and summer are the best months to visit. \r\n\nAs you continue on, you'll note that much of the land in the area is returning to a more natural state, with an influx of native grasses and wildflowers. The Parks Department has partnered with the Missouri Department of Conservation, U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, St. Louis Audubon Society, the Howard Bend Levee District, the U.S. Corps of Engineers, the City of Maryland Heights and the Saint Louis County Highways and Traffic Department to return this previously farmed area to its natural ecosystem. \r\n\nThe trail continues past all of these beautiful features.

The trail provides an adventure for bicyclists, hikers, runners, and equestrian users who are seeking an avenue to enjoy nature, explore a part of rural Missouri history, and have an enjoyable recreational opportunity.\r\n\nThe trail is built on the former corridor of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad (commonly called the Rock Island line). The trail takes users between Windsor and Pleasant Hill, with additional trailheads at Leeton, Chilhowee and Medford along the way.\r\n\nThe trail gives users an opportunity to explore Missouri\u2019s rural history as it travels through the small towns that once thrived along the railroad corridor. Along the way, the trail passes through prairie-like landscapes, picturesque farm fields and dense woodlands while crossing numerous streams. The trail is a designated section of the nationwide American Discovery Trail, a coast-to-coast non-motorized recreational trail.    \r\n\nThe Rock Island Spur can be enjoyed on its own or as part of a much longer trail experience. At Windsor, the trail connects to the 240-mile stretch of the Katy Trail that goes between Clinton to the west and Machens to the east in St. Charles County.\r\n\nThe Chicago, Rock Island, and Pacific Railroad, commonly called the Rock Island Line, had its first beginnings in 1852 when its ancestor, the Chicago and Rock Island Railroad, operated its first train between Chicago and Rock Island, Ill. The Rock Island system eventually stretched across Missouri as far west as Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Texas.\r\n\nThe section of the railroad from Windsor to Pleasant Hill traveled through a countryside of farm fields and grazing land, punctuated with evidence of quarries and coal-mining operations. The railroad provided an easy method of transportation for shipments of grain, vegetables, other agricultural goods, and coal. Existing towns prospered while new towns sprang up supported by the railroad. A sojourner on the section of railroad heading from Windsor (named for Windsor Castle) would have traveled through small communities such as Bowen, New Castle, Leeton, Post Oak, Chilhowee (a Cherokee name for the Tennessee or \u201cSmoky Mountain), Denton, Medford, Hadsell and Wingate before reaching Pleasant Hill (named for its \u201cpleasant situation on an elevated prairie.\u201d) During its heyday, the Rock Island Line lived up to its reputation made famous", "features": "Fall Colors \u00b7 Views", "condition": "Unknown"}, "ratings": {"rating": 5.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 48.3, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [1004, 797], "alt-change": [704, 651], "avg-grade": 1.0, "max-grade": 3.0}},

The trail can be  busy during the weekends especially during the warm summer months.\r\n\nGrants Trail is a key component in the Great Rivers Greenway attempt to link with the Meramec Greenway Trails and the River Des Peres trail system.

Through a narrow gap the trail begins its journey toward the northern end of the park. The narrow trail crosses various dry creek beds and a few moist seeps. Mosses and walking ferns find a home in the multiple moist rock outcroppings. \n\nAs with many of the woodlands in the urban area, Packwood is battling an infestation of honeysuckle. This exotic shrub originates in Asia, and was brought to America in the 1880s. The invasive species continues to threaten the native woodlands and flora. Dense honeysuckle foliage shades the native wildflowers, and prevents native woodland seeds from germinating. Even seedling oaks cannot penetrate the foliage to survive.  There may be grave consequences for the native wildlife over time.\n\nThe gradual ascent is about 5%, so the climb to the top of the bluff is mild.  Wooded hillsides provide shade during summer months. The trail opens up at the top of the bluff.  Mr. Packwood had built his house in this area, and it's easy to see why he chose the spot. The view is incredible.\n\nThe trail continues on past concrete fence posts and other structures from the Packwood days. The trail terminates where a future parking lot will be constructed off of Old State Road. \n\nThe Bluffview Trail is the first leg of a potential 11-mile trail system.

This paved trail has some beautiful sections, and the trail is stunning in every season. You can access the trail from the Al Foster Trailhead at Glencoe in Wildwood. The trail is multi-use, and you'll likely see bikers, hikers, and runners on your hike.\n\nYou'll begin on the Al Foster Trail before branching onto the Rock Hollow Trail after about one mile. The trail begins to slowly climb the valley which is heavily wooded. When you come to the first bench, look for a  small spring that can be found about 40 yards behind the bench at the base of a hill. The moist conditions make this spring pool and run a good habitat for mosses. This spring feeds the main creek, but because of all of the rocks in the main creek, the water disappears among the rock. The water is still flowing but not visible on the surface.\n\nSome of the largest Ohio Buckeyes can be found just north of the first set of benches. The buckeye is one of the first trees to lose its leaves in the fall. Accordingly to folklore, it is thought that carrying buckeye seeds in your pocket can bring good luck; however, the seeds are actually toxic to people and animals if eaten. In middle to late April, the lower valley is covered in bluebells and blue-eyed Marys. \n\nThe trail continues all the way up to Ridge Road by Ridge Elementary School, and the last half mile is somewhat steep. Fortunately for summer users, the trail is shaded the entire way. A number of seeps occur along the hillside and huge rock outcroppings can be seen from the trail. Additionally, there are interpretive signs along the trail. Be sure to take the time to fully explore the trail.\n\nOh yeah! Zombies!

For now, jump on the gravel road and turn left for a couple hundred feet. At the next parking lot, turn left.\r\n\nOne heads east a bit on a very gentle climb. Then, the trail turns south and hits you with a super steep climb full of rocks. Once you reach the top of the climb, the reward is a longer coast down toward another gravel road. Just before the road, the trail turns right for some rolling terrain before another extended climb. It isn't as bad as the last one, but you won't forget it. It's worth traveling this direction because of the last little bit.\r\n\nThe last section that takes one back down to the road on the west side is chocker-block full of rocks. Most are buried, but it seems that just as many are loose. And it is really steep. This downhill, and a couple of other climbs are what give this trail its intermediate rating.

No two sections of the trail are the same and the natural beauty surrounding the trail changes with the seasons. Food, lodging, and camping are all convenient to access from the trail for multi-day trips. Primarily, this trail is used by cyclists, but it is also used by thru-hikers. \r\n\nIn most places, trailheads and rest stops conveniently sit off to the side of the trail with water and facilities.  Occasionally, the trail follows along portions of the highway, however, the bulk follows the Missouri River, farmland, and forest. The trail is covered with a crushed stone, giving the feel of a hard dirt road. Being a prior railway, the trail is mostly flat and well marked along the way.\r\n\nAdditional trail information including up to date conditions, amenities, and trailhead guides can be found at here.

In the past, locals would bring the curious out to the area, but now it is becoming a popular destination in Saint Joseph.  \r\n\nThis is the core trail for this developing system.  It is easily reached from I-229.  Take the Highland Ave. exit.  Turn east, on Highland, and at the first road (Huntoon Rd.) turn left.  Follow this twisty road to the Sunbridge Hills parking lot.  It is also a short hike from the western tip of Krug Park MTB trail, as well.\r\n\nThe trail can be done in both directions.  \r\n\nHeading counterclockwise, you'll pass an old cemetery and a steel observation deck.  After the steepest section, you'll turn off the main trail, heading south.  There are two ways down.  The first left is the easier benched way down.  The second left is a steep downhill before a left turn that has a bit of exposure.  You decide which is best for you.  The views past the turn-offs are worth your time to check out before heading down the hill.\r\n\nThe \"lower\" section of the trail has some rock, but is not necessarily technical.  There is a substantial drop-off beside the trail in places.  A few places are narrow and the exposure is quite high.\r\n\nUse the Hiking Project mobile app to remind yourself to turn back up the hill.  Trails continue to the south and the turnoff can be easily missed.  The climb out isn't as steep as the data suggests.  It is an easy, although somewhat rocky, climb on a VERY old roadbed with a pleasant grade.  Don't forget to take the left turn at the top.  If you come out at the road, then you just passed it a few yards back.\r\n\nAfter passing the big white water tanks, and passing under power lines, the original trail keeps straight and is very obvious.  However, for the best experience (and some more hills), the newer extended trail branches off to the right into the trees eventually emerging at the parking lot.\r\n\nMost of the trail provides incredible views of the river valley.

Because of this, only historic route restoration was used as the process for the creation of this trail. Three early 20th Century homesteads created a spiderweb network of paths throughout. Invasive plant species and years of overgrowth were cleared from selected sections of this network to create a cohesive loop that provides a glimpse of every major feature of the wildlife area.\r\n\nAfter turning off of the North Loop, you'll start descending into the valley that bisects the area. Only 50 feet down the trail, you'll pass the end of the loop. Continue straight and, eventually, you'll cross the drainage that is only wet after rains. A bit of flat trail awaits before beginning the climb on the other side. The trail passes through a storage shed's foundation remains of an old farm and provides one of the most technical rock sections of the entire trail.\r\n\nThen the climbing begins. There are a couple very welcome recovery zones on the climb that will eventually lead you to an open area at the top of a hill with a nice view of the valley. At this point, the trail turns north for a gradual descent along the eastern property line. After turning to the west along the northern property line, the trail will pass through an old dumpsite and have some minor elevation changes as you traverse around one of the ridge tops. As you descend into an open grassy area, be prepared for the turn back into the trees. The singletrack in this section becomes very tight but it's, generally, downhill. A couple tight switchbacks lurk here. The trail reaches a more recent historic route before the end of the descent giving one the chance to let off the brakes.\r\n\nAfter crossing another drainage, a short climb brings you near the north property line where you go west briefly. As you notice a few rocks in the trail, slow down for one of the tightest turns. Then, you'll descend to a creek crossing just above a nice waterfall. Days after a good rain will bring out its best.\r\n\nAfter this crossing, the climb on the opposite side, and some very tight bench cut trail, one will reach an incredibly steep section that many have to dismount for. Some flat trail await above this. Then a long gradual climb takes you above the river on the hilltop to the west.
