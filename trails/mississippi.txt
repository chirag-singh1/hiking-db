The road is generally not visible from the trail, especially in the summer with one exception when the trail joins the road for just a few yards close to four miles down the trail. This trail is primarily tight singletrack which occasionally opens onto an old skid road and one fire break lane. The section contains several short climbs. There is one small rocky section of about 10 yards of exposed small sandstone near the power lines.\r\n\nSince the Noxubee Crest is a long ridge that forms the top of the watershed for the Noxubee River, the area is particularly scenic with impressive ravines dropping away from the Noxubee Crest area. The trail runs through mainly hardwoods forest. The fire break lane (between mile one and two) borders a stand of young pines. An overlook afforded by the power line right of way, approximately 3 1/2 mi down the trail, is worth a break to enjoy, particularly in the winter when leaves are off the trees. \r\n\nThe western end of this trail borders private land and ends when the trail Ts onto Rockcrusher Road, a gated forest road which is part of the trail system.
