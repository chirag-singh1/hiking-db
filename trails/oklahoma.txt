Why? There are a ton of rocks. Some as big as your fist, some small boulders. Make sure you have comfortable boots or trail shoes and focus on where your feet are stepping especially when carrying a 25-30 lb backpack. We started late in the evening at the Talimena State Park ONRT trailhead to get a feel for our load and camped at Mile Marker 1. There are two fire pits there and level ground to pitch tents.\r\n\nThe next 7 hours of hiking is over more rocks. I would say 80% of the trail is tricky due to rocks while ascending into some semi-steep and steep hills. If hiking during rainy season, you'll find water source but we stashed water at NF 6010 and Deadman's Gap which gave us plenty of them. The two, both accessible by road, are only 2 miles away.\r\n\nTrekking poles are a must. It will help you balance and do the ascent with comfort. The segment is clean, very little trash in firepits, unless it is high season when people leave empty plastic gallons of water at the Deadman's Gap crossing. Please pick them up after.\r\n\nThe third day, we drove to Horsethief Springs and did two miles without a pack and noticed not much rocks. The first 6-10 hours, depending on your speed and if carrying a full backpack, will be the toughest. The Talimena State Park host Harold was very helpful.

You can park in the gravel lot and hike either direction. The easiest way is to head up the bank on the small pond directly in front of the parking lot. The normal direction of the trail is clockwise so take a left on the pond bank and cross a small grassy service road and you jump up a rock face directly onto the granite rock trail.\r\n\nBe prepared! Within a few hundred feet of entering the trail you make a sharp right directly up a rock chute. Be careful of your footing here.\r\n\nYou'll hit the middle of the figure-eight that leads to the main West Loop about halfway into the loop.
