At 1.8 miles, the trail reconvenes with the Laura Cowles Trail coming in from the right. From here, it is a short scramble to the Long Trail. Take the Long Trail northbound on a short climb to the summit. Upon reaching the top, reward yourself by taking in the phenomenal views! To the north is Canada, and as you look eastward you can see Big Jay and Smugglers Notch (Madonna). Off the cliff to the east is Stowe Resort with the White Mountains in the distance, dominated primarily by the Franconia Ridgeline. To the south is Mansfield Ridgeline, Camel's Hump, Mt. Ellen, Mt.

From the parking lot here, you'll take either the CCC Road (1.0) or the Eagle Cut Trail (0.7) to the trailhead of the Sunset Ridge Trail.  It's a quick jaunt (0.1 miles) in from there to the junction of the Laura Cowles Trail.\r\n\nOnce on the trail, it pretty quickly reveals its true colors. You climb steadily along the right side of a gully formed by a mountain stream. In time, you'll leave the gully and the mixed hardwood forest behind and start to come into more of the spruce and juniper. The climb continues to be aggressive and has a few switchbacks to help prevent staircase climbing.\r\n\nThere is very little opportunity to sit and enjoy the fruits of your labor on this trail. The trees are thick even higher up on the mountain, and there aren't any outcroppings that allow for a clear view either in front or behind. Though the added benefit of this is that you're protected from the elements up to about 4000'. As you approach the end of the trail though it suddenly opens up to alpine tundra. Here the views are spectacular.  \r\n\nAfter 1.1 miles of thigh burning, you finally reconvene with the Sunset Ridge Trail. From here its a quick shot up the summit ridgeline for your summit bid. From the junction, turn south and follow Sunset Ridge Trail  (0.1) to its terminus when it meets the Long Trail at Thunderstorm Jct.

The descent from the north side of the mountain gets a little more technical, as it consists of ropes and ladders.  The trail crosses into Camel's Hump State Park and climbs over the peaks of Mount Ira Allen and Mount Ethan Allen.  The trail descends the ridgeline, then turns left (at Allis Trail).  In a short distance, you'll reach Montclair Glen Lodge.\r\n\nThe trail begins its ascent of Camel's Hump false summits.  After a few minor peaks, the real climb begins.  In the winter, the rime ice covers the blazes on the rocks, making it difficult to find the trail.  The trail descends open rock to Bamforth Ridge Shelter.  There's limited water along this exposed stretch, so be sure to bring ample water.  Bamforth Ridge Shelter is a large shelter with a few tent platforms.  It has a large cooking area with 3 bear boxes.\r\n\nThe trail descends down to Duxbury Window, an excellent view framed by tree branches.  The trail, also, passes by a few interesting caves along this stretch.  It descends to Duxbury Road and turns left.  It follows the road and travels along the edge of a few fields.  When the trail reaches the stream crossing at Honey Hollow Brook, there's the High Water Bypass option (if the stream is impassible).  It follows the edge of another field, before coming out to the road, again.  Follow the road, then cross over on the Winooski Footbridge.  Originally, the Long Trail continued along Duxbury Road to Jonesville and went up Stage Road.  Since the bridge's installation (in 2015), the Long Trail now follows the new route up to Stimson Mountain.  It ascends the slopes of Stimson Mountain as passes by Duck Brook Trail, the trail that was the original Long Trail.  The trail continues on to Buchanan Shelter.

Puffer Shelter offers excellent views of the surrounding area.\r\n\nIt traverses the mountains to arrive at Taylor Lodge, which is named in honor of James P. Taylor.  The water source is a piped spring off Lake Mansfield Trail.  There's also a tall cascade into a small pool, along this trail.  There are also a few views (at this shelter), one on top of the hill and Peter's Perch (in front of the shelter).\r\n\nThe trail continues into Nebraska Notch, which is a misleading name.  Nebraska isn't known for it's mountains, the only similarity is that there's a lot of corn grown in the nearby town of Moscow.  Leaving from Taylor Lodge, you also have the option of taking the Clara Bow Trail.  This trail is short trail that travels through caves and crevices, before re-connecting with the Long Trail.  Continue along the trail to Twin Brooks Tenting Area.  This tenting area has group tent platforms and single tent platforms.\r\n\nFrom here, the trail climbs up to Wallace Cut-Off.  This cut-off will take you to Butler Lodge, a 4-sided cabin just below The Forehead.  The climb (up to The Forehead) consists of climbing ladders, hugging rocks, traversing crevices and tightrope-walking over narrow bridges.  This area can be challenging if you're thru-hiking with a full pack.  Continue along the other facial geography of Mansfield to the true summit.  Mount Mansfield is the highest summit in Vermont, out of five (true) 4,000 footers.  The trail descends the ridge and takes a right turn just before the Adams Apple.  It descends to Taylor Lodge, a large 4-sided cabin that often has phenomenal sunrises.\r\n\nThe trail now follows a newer route down to 108.  Originally, the trail traveled down an unsustainable trail to the picnic area, but now it follows a brook down towards the visitor's center.  After crossing over Route 108, the trail turns right onto the Barnes Camp Loop.  It follows this behind the visitor's center, then turns left.  The trail ascends the slopes of Spruce Peak and travels to Sterling Pond Shelter.\r\n\nIt traverses over mountains to Whiteface Shelter, just below Whiteface Mountain.\r\n\nIt descends to Bear Hollow Shelter, a quiet shelter atop a small ledge.\r\n\nThe trail descends through an area known as West Settlement.  From here, the trail follows a series of dirt roads and snowmobile trails out towards Route 15.

As you continue through the woods ahead, watch and listen for Barred Owls, especially in late winter and early spring. Pileated Woodpeckers are common.

It climbs up to Bear Mountain, passing by a small vista trail.  Shortly after passing through Patch Hollow, the trail reaches an awesome spring with ice cold water.  The trail descends down to Minerva Hinchey Shelter.  This shelter is plagued with porcupines that may visit you in your sleeping bag.  The porcupines also come to the shelter to feed on the earthworms that hide beneath the leaf litter.  Stick to the white blazes, here, since there are many other little trails.\r\n\nThe trail follows a rocky ridge to Airport Lookout, where there are excellent views west.  The trail descends down to Clarendon Gorge and crosses over the bridge.  If it's a hot summer day, it would be wise to fill up on water before pushing on.  From Route 103, the trail climbs a series of stone stairs up to Clarendon Shelter.  Clarendon Shelter is a nice shelter located in a grassy grove.\r\n\nFrom Clarendon Shelter, the trail climbs to the top of a hill, then crosses over Lottery Road.  In a short distance from Lottery Road, there's a small spring (on the right).  After crossing over Upper Cold River Road, the trail travels through an area where portions have been re-located.  These re-locations are due to landslides, though one section takes you right along the edge of one of the landslides.  The trail continues moderately to Governor Clement Shelter.  Governor Clement Shelter is a good place to stay if winter weather is encroaching since it has a fireplace.\r\n\nFrom here, the trail follows an old road, then turns onto a singletrack up to Killington Peak.  The trail doesn't actually go over the summit of Killington, so you'll have to take a short sidetrip to bag this 4,000 footer.  While Cooper Lodge is still open to Thru-hikers, the lodge is drafty since all the windows are broken.  It's still unclear if the AMC/ GMC intend to remove this shelter.\r\n\nFollowing the trail north will take you to Churchill Scott Shelter.  Churchill Scott Shelter is a good stopping point if you intend to re-supply in Rutland.  The trail descends to Route 4, where division 5 ends.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Commonly Backpacked \u00b7 Historical Significance \u00b7 Spring \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7081293/governor-clement-shelter", "ratings": {"rating": 4.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 23.8, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [3982, 865], "alt-change": [5789, 5057], "avg-grade": 9.0, "max-grade": 52.0}},
