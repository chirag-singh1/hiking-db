Its rocky, open summit offers some of the park\u2019s best views of the islands to the east, not to mention a great view of the town of Bar Harbor to the northeast. If you\u2019re in the mood to climb Dorr, this short, classic, iron rung ladder trail offers the most exciting and fun route to the top. \r\n\nYou can approach this path from several directions. The most direct route is from the Dorr Mountain Ladder Trail Parking Lot located just to the west of Rte 3, which is just to the south of The Tarn, one of Acadia\u2019s smaller, and yet most picturesque, ponds. If that parking lot is full, you can also park in either The Tarn Parking Lot at the northern end of the pond and hike the Kane Path in a southward direction until you meet the ladder trail after 0.5 miles, or the Canon Brook Trail Parking Lot (also just off of Rte 3 and a little further south of the main parking lot), and hike part of the Canon Brook and Tarn trails roughly 0.5 miles in a northerly manner until you hit the path. \r\n\nThis trail climbs only slightly during the first 0.1 miles. At that point, however, the path ascends very quickly. From 0.2 miles, until it ends at the Schiff Path at 0.4 miles, this trail gains a significant amount of elevation, approximately 600 feet of climb in only 0.3 miles! And a good part of that hike occurs on iron rungs and several series of stone steps. Once you reach the Schiff Path, the climb to the top of Dorr is much more gradual. In order to summit via this route, follow the Schiff Path up the rest of the eastern face of the mountain, in a westward direction, for another 0.5 miles. Notably, the best approach to this trail is from the bottom.

At about 0.7 miles, the trail will become a little more gradual until you reach the end of the path at Champlain Mountain\u2019s summit at 1,058 feet. \r\n\nOnce you\u2019ve summited, do not try to go back down the trail. That would make it extremely difficult for others coming up the path, not to mention, put you in a much more dangerous situation than you were when you climbed up the path. To return to the start, take the Champlain North Ridge Trail northward for another 0.7 miles, until it intersects with the Orange and Black Path, which you can than follow back southward toward the parking lot for another mile. \r\n\nOverall, this is a highly rewarding trail, but one that you must be in good shape to tackle, not to mention free from any fear of heights.", "features": "Views \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7017558/precipice-trail-lives-up-to-its-name", "ratings": {"rating": 4.9, "num_reviewers": 30}, "stats": {"dist": 0.8, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [1043, 120], "alt-change": [951, 28], "avg-grade": 24.0, "max-grade": 54.0}},

Its charming view of The Bubbles is one of the park\u2019s most recognizable scenes. It also attracts a lot of people because of the relatively flat and gentle carriage road that circles the entire lake. It\u2019s surprising then that this path, which is Eagle Lake\u2019s only trail, isn\u2019t very crowded, at least it hasn\u2019t been when I\u2019ve visited it. Part of the answer might be that the path skirts the southern part of the lake and that general area already contains the much more popular Bubbles Trail nearby. Whatever the case, the Eagle Lake Trail is a pleasant hike on a well-forested path that gets you away from the lake\u2019s much more heavily-trafficked carriage road. \r\n\nYou can get to this trail a few ways. The closest parking is in the small Bubble Pond lot about 0.4 miles southeast of the eastern end of the path. Another approach is from the western side of the Eagle Lake Carriage Road, which connects to the trail's western trailhead. But the closest parking for that route is approximately 2 miles to the north of the lake. A third method is to follow the Jordan Pond Carry roughly 0.8 miles northward from The Bubbles parking lot until it runs into the trail. That approach, however, puts you at approximately the halfway point of the trail and you\u2019ll have to travel in a \u201cT\u201d shaped pattern if you want to hike the entire path.\r\n\nThis trail is an almost flat path that passes through a low-lying pine forest right off the lake. Even though it is a very tranquil setting, you\u2019ll still need to watch your step as the trail contains several rocks and roots. Lovely ferns line parts of the path, and when you get to the trail\u2019s lower areas there is a series of single wooden plank bridges to help you move over the often soggy and muddy ground. The only minor challenge you\u2019ll face is when you have to contour over the rocky bottom of Conners Nubble on the northwestern part of the trail. \r\n\nOn a personal note, although dogs are allowed, you might want to think twice before taking a smaller one along. The last time I did this trail, we took a friend\u2019s Puggle with us. Shortly after starting the hike, however, we quickly came across a rather significant boulder field; he didn\u2019t even want to attempt it and I had to haul him over all of that rock. Still, larger dogs probably won\u2019t have a problem getting across such obstacles. \r\n\nOverall, this is a lovely little hike among a nicely scented pine forest. It\u2019s a great way to get away from the hubbub of the northern part of Eagle Lake,", "features": "Lake \u00b7 Views", "condition": "All Clear"}, "ratings": {"rating": 3.4, "num_reviewers": 5}, "stats": {"dist": 1.8, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [306, 275], "alt-change": [127, 121], "avg-grade": 3.0, "max-grade": 10.0}},

It\u2019s one of the park\u2019s smaller ponds, yet also one of its most picturesque. Many people overlook it because it\u2019s not as well-known as some of Acadia\u2019s larger bodies of water, but if you take this trail along its western shore, you\u2019ll get some terrific and memorable views, guaranteed. \r\n\nYou can easily access the Kane Path from two different parking lots. One is the Beachcroft Path lot at The Tarn\u2019s northern end, while the other is the Dorr Mountain Ladder Trail lot at the pond\u2019s southern end. Although this trail technically runs for a total of 0.8 miles from The Tarn\u2019s northwestern tip, to roughly 0.3 miles past its southern end, some people think of it as two separate trails, while others call the entire path something else. Essentially, most people refer to the trail\u2019s entire 0.8 miles as Kane Path, but others call it Tarn Trail. Still others\u2014largely thanks to the area\u2019s most popular hiking map\u2014call the northern 0.5 miles the Kane Path, and the southern 0.3 miles Tarn Trail.  Although this is sometimes confusing, it\u2019s still important to know that different names exist for certain parts, or all, of this trail. \r\n\nThis path is one of the park\u2019s easiest trails. There is hardly any elevation gain. Several large, well-placed, stepping stones help you skim the surface of The Tarn\u2019s western edge. Along the way, you\u2019ll get some terrific views of the surrounding mountains, and the water bound flora and fauna of this placid pond.  After 0.5 miles, you\u2019ll come across the eastern trailhead of the Dorr Mountain Ladder Trail, which climbs up to the west, as well as the heavily forested section of the valley, just to The Tarn\u2019s south. This section of the path runs for 0.3 miles until it connects with the Canon Brook Trail.  Notably, the northern end of Kane Path also links-up with several other trails including Jesup Path, Kurt Diederich\u2019s Climb, and the Beachcroft Path, so lots of options exist to extend your outing into a more challenging hike. \r\n\nThis was absolutely the very first trail in Acadia that I ever did. We first set foot on it when we began a circuit up Dorr Mountain and I will always have great memories of it.

This path also links-up with several other trails and offers circuit hikes in various directions.  \r\n\nYou can approach this path several ways. Its eastern trailhead is located directly off the Canon Brook Trail Parking Lot, just south of The Tarn on Rte 3. Its western end is atop the southern ridge of Cadillac Mountain, right at The Featherbed, and where the Cadillac South Ridge Trail and the Bubble and Jordan Ponds Path intersect. You can also linkup with the path at roughly its halfway point at Dorr Mountain\u2019s southern base via either the A. Murray Young Path or the Dorr South Ridge Trail. The closest accessible parking is the Canon Brook Trail Parking Lot. \r\n\nBeginning from the eastern trailhead, this path gradually descends for 0.2 miles until it turns sharply southward and follows the west side of the stream of its namesake. It\u2019s relatively flat here and provides a peaceful feeling as you skirt some small ponds and waterfalls. Then, you\u2019ll reach Dorr Mountain\u2019s southern base after another 0.7 miles. There, the trails turns sharply westward and descend alongside the marsh that runs along Otter Creek\u2019s northern part. Along the way you\u2019ll see the Dorr South Ridge Trail descending and intersecting from the north. After another 0.2 miles, the A. Murray Young Path will also intersected from the north and then you\u2019ll begin quickly ascending Cadillac Mountain\u2019s southeastern side. It\u2019s very steep and rocky for the first 0.5 miles of this climb and then becomes more gradual in the last 0.4 miles, at which point you\u2019ll reach the path\u2019s western trailhead.

Sargent has a relatively flat, wide open, rocky summit that provides spectacular panoramic views. Toward the east, you can see such key sites as the ocean and outlying islands, Eagle Lake, Cadillac Mountain, Jordan Pond, Pemetic Mountain, and the Bubbles, while to the west you can see Somes Sound, Norumbega Mountain, Southwest Harbor, and all of the area\u2019s western peaks. Even though you\u2019ll have to work a little harder to summit Sargent than some of the park\u2019s other mountains, the end view will be well worth it.\r\n\nYou can access this path from either Sargent\u2019s summit or from the northwest. There are several ways to get to the top, should you want to take this path in a downward direction.  Some people come from the south over Penobscot Mountain and its various trails.  Others approach from the west and southwest over Parkman Mountain and Bald and Gilmore Peaks. Still, others come from the Bubbles and Jordan Pond trails in the east. But for those who want to use the trail to summit Sargent, the only approach is from the northwest where the path intersects with the Giant Slide Trail and the Parkman Mountain Trail (the best parking spots are just on the side of Highway 198/3). Overall, there are a number of ways to get to this path, so it\u2019s best to consult a map and plan accordingly.  \r\n\nMost adventurers connect to this path via the Giant Slide Trail. Starting at the northwestern end of the path, you\u2019ll quickly climb in an eastward direction for approximately 170 feet for 0.3 miles until you come across one of the park\u2019s famous and numerous carriage roads. Then the contours start stacking-up very closely together; over the next 0.7 miles to the summit, there is roughly a 600 foot climb. Along the way, you\u2019ll see where Chasm Brook begins and rolls off Sargent\u2019s north side. This section of the trail makes several distinct changes in direction, until you finally hit the exposed, rocky summit.  Enjoy the views, because you worked hard for them. \r\n\nIn sum, this path can supplement your trip to the top of Sargent in a variety of ways, so be sure to look at a map when planning your journey.

For an approximate 0.75 mile trail, this path provides a huge return of visual memories.   \r\n\nYou can access this trail from either end, but the best approach is from its eastern side, where it connects with the Deer Brook Trail and Jordan Cliffs Trail. Traveling the path in that direction allows you to climb the steepest part of the trail very quickly, rather than saving it for the end, which can be very tricky to descend, especially when it\u2019s wet. The closest parking for the eastern trailhead is actually at the small Bubble Rock parking lot on the west side of the Park Loop Road located approximately a mile away.

It\u2019s one of the area\u2019s earliest mountain paths and was around before Acadia even became a national park. Only 1.5 miles long, with roughly 600 feet of climb (depending on the direction you take), it is one of Champlain\u2019s few intermediate paths, as opposed to most of the mountain\u2019s more extreme trails. \r\n\nYou can start your journey from either Champlain\u2019s summit or from its southern end just south of The Bowl, a small and well-known pond that\u2019s nestled between Enoch Mountain, The Beehive, and Halfway Mountain. The closest parking areas are either the Beaver Dam lot at the northern end of the mountain (approximately 1 mile away from the north end of the trail) or the Beehive Trail parking area to the southeast (which is also roughly a mile away from the path, but from the southern section of it).  In fact, you can\u2019t really get to either the northern or southern end of the trail without first having to hike up one of several paths to its north (including the Precipice Trail, the Beechcroft Path, or the Champlain North Ridge Trail), or either the Bowl Trail or the Beehive Trail to its south. Obviously, you can traverse this trail in either direction. It\u2019s not nearly as steep and precarious as many of Champlain\u2019s other paths, so it easily permits 2-way traffic.   \r\n\nBasically, the hike on the Champlain South Ridge is more gradual than the trail on the northern part of the mountain. It\u2019s half a mile longer than its northern counterpart and has about a 300 foot less difference in elevation gain/loss. Regardless of which direction you head, you\u2019ll navigate your way through pines and granite. There will also be many views of the area\u2019s outlying islands and the Atlantic to your east and nice views of Cadillac Mountain and Dorr Mountain to the west, as well as some postcard-worthy looks at The Beehive and The Bowl to the south. As always be sure to follow the carefully constructed cairns to guide you through the open areas, and ignore the extra rock piles that some have thoughtlessly placed along the way\u2014those \u201cfalse\u201d cairns sometimes confuse hikers. \r\n\nThis hike is one of Mountain Desert Island\u2019s original trails, and it offers some great views of Acadia and its surrounding areas.

Of all of this peak\u2019s paths, this one is definitely the most friendly and accessible.   \r\n\nThe best way to approach this trail is from the Jordan Pond House parking lot. For those who don\u2019t have a car, the free Island Explorer bus also drops off close to that spot. \r\n\nThis path technically begins at approximately the midpoint of the Bubble and Jordan Ponds Trail. So, you\u2019ll have to have traveled in approximately 0.6 miles on that path from the Jordan Pond House area before you reach the Pemetic South Ridge Trailhead. \r\n\nThe hike starts in the piney forests on the lower part of Pemetic and eventually pops out onto the southern rocky ridge of the mountain. The climb is fairly gradual over roughly the first 0.25 miles, then you\u2019ll come to a steep area for approximately the next 0.2 miles until the trail eventually becomes more gradual once again. At 0.6 miles up the path, the Pemetic East Cliff Trail will link-up with the path coming in from the southeast. From there it\u2019s another 0.5 miles northward to the summit, where you\u2019ll have a fantastic 360-degree view of several of the park\u2019s key bodies of water (including Jordan Pond, Eagle Lake and Bubble Pond), as well as some terrific looks at several of the park\u2019s other key mountains (including Cadillac, Penobscot, The Bubbles, and Sargent).   \r\n\nOverall, this trail is probably the \u201ceasiest\u201d way to ascend Pemetic. It is the least challenging of the mountain\u2019s trail system, but it\u2019s still got a lot of elevation gain.

Despite its physical demands, this path can provide a lot of fun for those who are in decent shape and like the challenge of a significant climb. Although most people merely consider it an approach path to Norumbega\u2019s summit, this trail has several enjoyable aspects to recommend it.\r\n\nThere is only one main access point to this path. The trail starts out right at the edge of the Norumbega Mountain Pull-Off Parking Area located directly off Route 3, just a little bit above Upper Hadlock Pond. If that lot is full, you can always park well off to the side of the road, as many people do. \r\n\nThis path is only 0.6 miles, but it\u2019s a very steep and rocky climb, and one that should not be taken lightly. It has an elevation gain of over 550 feet, complete with several nice and significant granite ledges and cliffs. One really does feel like a goat at various points along this path. The bottom half of the trail is well-forested, but as you get closer to the top there are several open areas, which are still surrounded by sizable trees, so the views can sometimes leave you wanting. Nevertheless, when you finally reach Norumbega\u2019s rocky summit at 852 feet, which is also the southern end of this trail, you\u2019ll get some decent views of Somes Sound and the park\u2019s western mountains. But don\u2019t count on getting a full vista at the summit as vegetation obscures part of the view there and along most of the Norumbega Mountain Trail. Please note that you should really only hike up the Goat Trail, rather than try to descend it. The southern part of the Norumbega Mountain Trail, which runs off the summit, connects with the Hadlock Ponds Trail and offers a much easier and more pleasant hike down the mountain.  \r\n\nOverall, most people tend to dismiss this trail as merely a connector to Norumbega\u2019s summit, but for those adventurers who don\u2019t have a lot of time on their hands, and who enjoy scaling steep, rocky areas, complete with some sizable granite ledges, this is quite a fun trail.

Still, it is not for someone who is afraid of heights.\r\n\nEssentially, this path traverses the steep eastern side of Penobscot Mountain.You should begin your hike at the southern trailhead, just off the Spring Trail, which, itself, only runs for about 0.3 miles from the Jordan House parking lot and Island Explorer bus stop. \r\n\nWorking your way up the Jordan Cliffs Trail from the south allows you to warm-up and start climbing moderately until you begin to reach the challenging crags at about the halfway point. At the start, you'll quickly cross one of the park\u2019s many famous carriage roads and begin ascending the somewhat rocky and heavily rooted trail through a forested canopy. Just a little to your west, you'll see one of Penobscot Mountain\u2019s many streams. It won\u2019t take long before you come across several intermittent exposed cliffs that look eastward over Jordan Pond and toward The Bubbles. About halfway up the trail, you\u2019ll hit a series of several stairs and handrails. Eventually, they will take you down just a bit before you begin your final ascent over the more technical cliff section of the path. The last part of the journey\u2014and the highlight for many\u2014is a steep climb up a fixed iron rung ladder. When you reach the top of the trail, which finishes on a large cliff with great vistas, you get one of the most iconic, picture post-card views of Acadia - Jordan Pond and The Bubbles. Don\u2019t miss your chance to capture the moment with a selfie, group photo, and/or simple nature shot. \r\n\nYou can return to the start a couple of ways. Most people take the easier Deer Brook Trail, which will intersect your path to the north at about 1.7 miles. Follow the Deer Brook Trail down 0.3 miles to the northern edge of Jordan Pond, and then hike the Jordan Pond Path around either the eastern or western part of the pond for roughly 1.5 miles until you reach the Jordan House area again. Another return option is via the Penobscot East Trail, which you come across at 1.5 miles into the hike, right before hiking into the Deer Brook path. The Penobscot East Trail leaves Jordan Cliffs in a southwestern manner and ascends for 0.5 miles to the Penobscot Mountain Trail, another park favorite.

For those looking for an easy to moderate hike with little climb, it\u2019s hard to go wrong with this trail.\r\n\nThis trail intersects with eight different trails and carriage roads along its 1.9 miles. Several of those paths connect with the top of Cedar Swamp Mountain and Penobscot Mountain, both to the north, and offer a number of circuit hike options for those who want a more strenuous outing. You can access this trail from multiple directions, so it is best to consult a map to figure out your approach.

For anyone who wants to ditch their car, the free Island Explorer Bus also stops at both of those sites.\r\n\nThis trail dates back to the late 19th century - long before Acadia became a national park - but it has received several upgrades since then.

At 852 feet, it definitely isn\u2019t one of Acadia\u2019s taller peaks, but it usually doesn\u2019t have much foot traffic and offers a nice little jaunt in the woods with occasional glimpse of the park\u2019s western mountains, as well as some of Acadia\u2019s more towering eastern peaks. Many consider Norumbega to be the approximate midpoint of Mount Desert Island (MDI), and because of its central location, most people often overlook this peaceful and fun trail.\r\n\nYou can access this trail from either end. The north trailhead starts at the mountain\u2019s summit, where it intersects with the Goat Trail, which is a short but steep climb up the eastern side of the mountain. You can reach the southern end of this path at the southwestern tip of Lower Hadlock Pond, where it intersects with the Hadlock Ponds Trail. The closest parking lot is located right at the start of the Goat Trail along Route 3, and if it fills up, people just park along the side of this relatively wide roadway.  For those who want to ditch the car, there is an Island Explorer bus stop just at the eastern side of Lower Hadlock Pond, which isn\u2019t far from the southern end of the path.\r\n\nNorumbega is a moderate trail that is fairly wooded with lots of pines. It has roughly 650 feet of elevation change over its 1.3 mile length. At various spots along the path you\u2019ll get some nice views of Somes Sound, which many still refer to as the East\u2019s only fjord due to its steep and deep nature, but technically scientists have downgraded it to a fjard because it doesn\u2019t measure up to all of the specific traits of a Scandinavian fjord. Whatever the case, Somes is one of Acadia\u2019s most picturesque bodies of water, particularly on a sunny day. But don\u2019t count on getting a full vista at the top of the mountain as vegetation obscures part of the view at the summit and along most of the trail. Still, we really enjoyed this trail because of its lack of other visitors and the great scent of pine trees along the way.  \r\n\nOverall, this trail is not Acadia\u2019s most stunning path by any means. Nevertheless, it offers a great deal of solace and some occasionally pleasant views, not to mention an escape from the hubbub of several of the park\u2019s other venues that are often overrun by tourists, particularly in the summer months.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 Spring \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7019272/sargent-mountain", "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 1.3, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [836, 198], "alt-change": [640, 2], "avg-grade": 10.0, "max-grade": 30.0}},

That section of Mount Desert Island (MDI) is the quietest and least traveled. Even during the crowded summer months, you can take refuge for quite a while on some of the park\u2019s western trails without seeing anyone. And of all of the paths on that part of MDI, this trail is one of the most pleasant you\u2019ll find.\r\n\nThe best place to access this trail is from the parking lot located directly at the southern end of the pond. There is also another parking lot some 0.4 miles to the west of the trailhead at Gilley Field, should the main parking lot be full, but we\u2019ve never had a problem parking. \r\n\nThis trail starts at the southern tip of Long Pond and runs along its southwestern shore for about 1.7 miles. It then turns sharply back to the southwest and climbs a section of the northern parts of Mansell Mountain and Bernard Mountain until it finally deadends into the Great Notch Trail after a total of 3.1 miles. Technically, you can take this trail in either direction, but most people find that the most pleasant approach is from the south in a counterclockwise fashion. \r\n\nThis trail offers some nice views of the peaceful pond and is well-forested with pines. The last time we took this path, there were several people sunning themselves on the rocks along the pond\u2019s shoreline. Others were floating placidly in their inner tubes. Pine needles blanket parts of the trail, but other sections can get a bit muddy and slippery due to mountain runoff. The elevation change during the first part of the trail is very slight. At 1.7 miles, however, there is a little bit of a climb as you ascend from Long Pond\u2019s shoreline for roughly 1.4 miles to the trail\u2019s southwestern end at approximately 500 feet. At that point, you can take the Great Notch Trail in a southeastern direction until you hit the saddle between Mansell and Bernard, where you\u2019ll have several different trail options to either return to the parking lot or extend the day\u2019s outing a bit longer.\r\n\nOverall, this is a terrific trail that is not very well-known or used. We believe it to be perhaps the best trail around one of Acadia\u2019s ponds. If you have the opportunity, I highly recommend you put this one on your list\u2014you won\u2019t be sorry!

In less than a mile, it climbs close to 900 feet up the eastern side of Mansell Mountain. It\u2019s well worth traveling to the western part of Acadia for this trail, the area of the park with the least amount of traffic (both foot and vehicle). This trail will provide you with some great memories, guaranteed.\r\n\nThe best place to access this route is from the Long Pond Trail, which skirts along the southeastern shore of Long Pond. The parking lot located directly at the southern tip of the pond is your best bet for leaving your car. There is also another lot some 0.4 miles to the west of Long Pond at Gilley Field. Unfortunately, the closest Island Explorer bus stop is about a mile-and-a-half to the east at Smuggles Den, and there\u2019s no trail that will lead you directly from there to link-up with the Perpendicular Trailhead.\r\n\nThis trail climbs very little for the first 0.2 miles, as it leaves the Long Pond Trail in a westward direction. But then, it starts ascending very quickly to the north-northwest. The area is well-forested, and you'll only have a few quick views beyond the trees until you get close to Mansell Mountain\u2019s summit, which tops out at 949 feet. As you work your way up the steep and rugged eastern side of Mansell, you'll run across several series of stone stairs and iron rungs. You\u2019ll also cross a major rock slide area, as well as have to negotiate numerous switchbacks. At times\u2014just as the trail\u2019s name suggests\u2014you might feel as if you\u2019re traveling almost perpendicular to Mansell\u2019s eastern face. \r\n\nJust before you summit, the trail will turn back quickly to the west and there will be a nice overlook. There are some great views of the western part of the park and its peaks, as well as Long Pond and parts of Somes Sound. Once you reach the top, you can take the Mansell Mountain Trail to the south, down for another a mile, until you link up with the Cold Brook Trail, which you can take 0.4 miles to the east to return to the parking lot.\r\n\nOverall, this is a short, rugged, and highly rewarding route that lives up to its namesake.  Those with a sense of adventure should not miss it, especially because it arguably rivals several of Acadia\u2019s other well-known steep and challenging trails, such as the Precipice Trail, Jordan Cliffs Trail, and the Beehive Trail.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 Views", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7061956/overlook-on-perpendicular-trail", "ratings": {"rating": 4.5, "num_reviewers": 20}, "stats": {"dist": 0.9, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [933, 79], "alt-change": [855, 1], "avg-grade": 18.0, "max-grade": 74.0}},

About halfway to the summit, the Cadillac Cliffs Path veers off from the trail (ultimately to rejoin it after 0.3 miles). \r\n\nContinue along the main trail and the views will get better and better as you approach the bald summit. To the south are nice views of Otter Cliff and Otter Point. To the northeast you can see Sand Beach and Great Head. After enjoying the views, continue along the trail as it heads down the northern side of Gorham Mountain and ultimately merges with the Bowl Trail.\r\n\nThanks to guidebook author and photographer, James Kaiser, for sharing this trail description.

The high point is about 0.4 miles into the hike when traveling northward (the entire path is only 1.1 miles long). You'll come across several rocks and roots during your trek, but you can easily cross them. You\u2019ll also see multiple ferns lining the path on this well-shaded trail.

It is one of the park\u2019s first paths. Rudolf-Ernst Br\u00fcnnow, a Princeton University professor - and the designer of some of the park\u2019s other famous trails including the Precipice Trail (to which this path links) - was the main builder of this path in the early 1910s. Its name comes from Princeton\u2019s colors\u2014Orange and Black. Throughout the years, the path has endured some significant rock slides, including one in the 1990s and one in the mid-2000s, which was the result of a sizable earthquake. The park had to shut it down for a few years after the earthquake to repair all of the damage, but the trail was back in action by late 2009.\r\n\nThis path is the best way to get to the second half of the Precipice Trail, and one of the few ways to connect to the northern portion of the Champlain Ridge trails. The full hike starts where the trail meets the western side of the Schooner Head Path. There is no parking close to the trailhead. Your best bet is to park in the Precipice Trail parking lot located next to the Park Loop Road. From there, hike eastward on Murphy Lane for 0.3 miles, and then take the Schooner Head Path north along a low-lying marshy area for roughly another 0.7 miles. \r\n\nThe trail starts out very gradually for the first 0.25 miles until it crosses over the Park Loop Road. From there you\u2019ll start ascending rather quickly, including a series of rock stairs that crosses one of the rockslide areas of the trail. At about 0.5 miles you\u2019ll reach a trail junction. To continue on the Orange and Black Path, turn to the south (if you head to the north you\u2019ll reach the Champlain Ridge North Trail in roughly 0.1 miles). Hiking southward on the Orange and Black Path, you\u2019ll run into the Precipice Trail in another 0.5 miles. That\u2019s where this trail technically ends and you should double back and retrace your steps to the beginning. One could go down the first half of the Precipice Trail, although it is not recommended due to that fact that the Precipice Trail can get quite crowded and it\u2019s difficult to negotiate the steep climb down in the opposite direction of most hikers. \r\n\nIn sum, this trail is very rocky, but provides some great views of Frenchman Bay and Schoodic Peninsula to the east. Treading up the path not only gives you great views, but also a connection to the past, to a time when the park\u2019s first trails started to come into existence.", "features": "Fall Colors \u00b7 Views", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7043470/the-precipice-and-orange-and-black-trail-acadia-national-park", "ratings": {"rating": 4.4, "num_reviewers": 5}, "stats": {"dist": 0.9, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [449, 67], "alt-change": [218, 487], "avg-grade": 15.0, "max-grade": 42.0}},

Somes, which many people still refer to as the East\u2019s only fjord due to its steep and deep nature, is actually a \u201cfjard\u201d because it technically doesn\u2019t meet the official scientific standards of a Scandinavian \u201cfjord\u201d. We embarked on this path late one day in order to access the Valley Peak Trail and get a clearer view of the sound; we chose this particular path because of its peaceful nature and due to the fact that it is not as well travelled as the other approaches to Valley Peak. For those who want a terrific look at Somes Sound (one of Acadia\u2019s best bodies of water), this is a rewarding way to access it. \r\n\nYou can approach this trail from either the north or from the west (though this approach drops you off in the middle of the trail). The northern trailhead starts right at Route 102, just across the highway from the small Acadia Mountain parking lot. The western approach to the path is made via the Ledge Trail, also just off of Route 102 (but that path is located directly across from the Saint Sauveur Mountain parking lot). The Ledge Trail then meets up with the Saint Sauveur Trail at about its halfway point, just a little bit shy of the mountain\u2019s summit. For those who want to simply rely on public transportation, there is also an Island Explorer bus stop at that same parking lot.  \r\n\nThis trail is heavily wooded with lots of pines. It\u2019s an easy to fairly moderate path that climbs to Saint Sauveur\u2019s obscured summit, which then links up with the Valley Peak Trail. Many people choose to access Valley Peak from either the north via the Acadia Mountain Trail or from the south via the Flying Mountain Trail, but others find the Saint Sauveur path one of the best and most relaxing ways to link-up with the trail- we sure did.   \r\n\nStarting from the northeast trailhead, which you can access either off of Route 102 or the Man O' War Brook Fire Road, the trail climbs gradually through the forest in a southerly manner. At about 0.75 miles, you\u2019ll run across the Ledge Trail coming in from the west. In another 0.2 miles, you\u2019ll summit Saint Sauveur, and even though the top of the mountain is open to the sky, the trees that butt up against the summit cut off most of the view below.

Along the way, there you\u2019ll see several unique natural sights, including the small but charming Sargent Mountain Pond, as well as a wide variety of wildflowers. \r\n\nThe best way to get to this path is from the Brown Mountain Gatehouse parking lot just off of Highway 198/3. After 0.7 mile, navigate on a series of the park\u2019s well-known carriage roads, you\u2019ll reach the southern trailhead of this path. From there, it\u2019s a long, gradual, climb up to the eastern edge of the summit of Cedar Swamp Mountain (942 feet), and then another 430 feet up to the top of Sargent Mountain, where several trails intersect and offer a number of different routes down the mountain, if you don\u2019t feel like retracing your steps.  \r\n\nThe journey up this trail begins in a well-forested evergreen area and occasionally juts out into slightly exposed sections before you hit the rocky southern ridge of Sargent. Once there, a series of cairns will help guide you to the top of Acadia\u2019s second highest peak. While climbing, you\u2019ll see a variety of wildflowers, and the mountain\u2019s unique small pond, which several scientists believe is the first \u201clake\u201d that emerged in Maine during the earth\u2019s geological formation. Please be sure to keep close track of the \u201creal\u201d cairns to guide you through the open areas, and ignore the extra rock piles that some have thoughtlessly placed along the way - the \u201cfalse\u201d cairns sometimes confuse visitors. \r\n\nAt the summit, there are some outstanding 360-degree views - some of the island\u2019s best. To the east you\u2019ll see such key sites as the Atlantic Ocean and the area\u2019s outlying islands, Eagle Lake, Cadillac Mountain, Jordan Pond, Pemetic Mountain, and the Bubbles, and to the west you\u2019ll see Somes Sound, Norumbega Mountain, Southwest Harbor, and all of the area\u2019s western peaks. Although you\u2019ll have to work a little harder to summit Sargent than some of the park\u2019s other mountains, the final view will be well worth it. \r\n\nOverall, this path is one of the longer routes to Sargent\u2019s summit.

However, if you are looking a challenge, this trail offers plenty of steep and rugged grades. \r\n\nStarting the trail from the Mill Field parking lot, the trail begins a steady incline up the mountain, crossing three creeks.

After you pass this, there will be occasional steep sections but nothing like the first 0.9 miles of the trail until you reach the summit, which offers spectacular views of the western portion of MDI and Acadia. There is an overlook if you go just past the summit, about 150 feet down the trail. \r\n\nAfter the summit and the overlook, you'll get a taste of what is to come later on in the trail with a rugged and steep descent. Once at the bottom of this first descent, the trail comes to an intersection with Sluiceway Trail and there is a sign marking the minor peak of Little Notch. Continuing on the trail, you begin a steep and short rugged ascent of Knights Nubble where you find the minor peak right after you finish the ascent. Then you can enjoy the views once more as you are offered another overlook past the summit of Knight Nubble. \r\n\nThen you begin an extremely steep and rugged descent of Knight Nubble. Then after the harsh descent, you are rewarded with a level trail through the woods until you reach the final descent which, again, is rugged and steep, just not quite as steep as when you come off of Knight Nubble.

It sits just to the east of Cadillac Mountain and reaches a height of 1270 feet. Of the two Dorr ridge trails, this \u201cNorth Ridge\u201d trail is the shorter and more gradual of the two. Technically, this path does not actually crest the mountain. However, you can link-up directly with the \u201cSouth Ridge\u201d trail, which will take you the short distance to Dorr\u2019s stony summit where you\u2019ll get some terrific views of the water and islands to the east, as well as a distinct look at the town of Bar Harbor to the northeast.   \r\n\nYou can take this trail in either direction.  Whichever route you choose, you\u2019ll encounter an elevation change of approximately 850 feet over roughly 0.9 miles. Its northern trailhead intersects with the Hemlock Trail in the saddle between Dorr Mountain and Kebo Mountain to the north. Its southern end intersects with the Schiff Path coming in from the east, the Dorr South Ridge Trail rising up from the south, and the Gorge Path connecting from the west. The lower part of this trail begins in a pine forest, while the upper part traverses more exposed, rocky, areas the closer you are to the summit. There are several places you can park to access this trail, so it\u2019s best to consult a map and plan accordingly. \r\n\nIn sum, this trail has a little less climb than its southern counterpart. And even though some people consider a summit push a moderate outing, it can still surprise some with close to an average 20% grade.

It runs for approximately 2.9 miles along one Acadia's easternmost edges and overlooks Frenchman Bay. The path extends from Sols Cliff in the north to Schooner Head in the south. Its northern end links up with the Compass Harbor Trail near the ruins of George Dorr's Old Farm estate (Dorr is considered \"The Father of Acadia\", the person most responsible for helping to create the national park), while the southern trailhead is located at the Schooner Head Overlook parking lot, about 0.3 miles east of the Park Loop Road's entrance station at the base of Enoch Mountain. For those who want to hike it from the north, there is also parking close to Dorr's farm. Obviously, you can hike this path in either direction due to its accessibility. \r\n\nSchooner Head Path is an easy trail that is relatively flat with less than 100 feet of elevation change overall. It has some stunning views as it looks out over many of the area's outlying islands and beyond. The hike begins at either end in a pleasant set of woods. Along the way, you'll walk across the top of some significant, but safe, cliffs and see several ponds to the west at points along the way. Notably, the Orange & Black Path and Murphy Lane both link up with the western side of this trail and can provide access to Champlain Mountain, if you so desire. But it's really nice to hike this path leisurely by itself. Essentially, this trail provides quite a relaxing mood and a sense of the area's history for all those who are patient enough to slow down and enjoy it.", "features": "Views", "condition": "Unknown"}, "ratings": {"rating": 2.8, "num_reviewers": 5}, "stats": {"dist": 2.9, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [143, 43], "alt-change": [191, 143], "avg-grade": 2.0, "max-grade": 10.0}},

There is a small kiosk that has some old photos of Jockey Cap when it was a ski run, and some information on the store that sits below Jockey Cap. \r\n\nThe trail leads into the woods where several foot trails lead uphill. The main trail is marked by yellow blazes on the trees, but all of the small paths will lead uphill toward the granite dome. The trail is mainly a single dirt track that runs through the woods uphill, which provide a great amount of shade throughout the spring and summer. The trail becomes a little washed out in areas toward the top, but a new path that is less steep and washed out runs around and leads to the top. \r\n\nAs the trail approaches the top, the woods give way to the granite summit. Hike out onto the granite dome, and work your way up the rock face toward a stone monument at the top dedicated to Robert E. Peary, the arctic explorer, who called Fryeburg home from 1878 to 1879. On top of the monument is a bronze profile of the surrounding mountains that allows you to identify the mountains, hills, and lakes. The White Mountains spread out before you and on a clear day, you can see Mount Washington in the distance. You can see Lovewell Pond, the Molly Ockett School, and other Fryeburg landmarks. \r\n\nYou can descend via the same path that you took to get to the top, or take one of the many side trails. The trail goes by some boulders at the bottom of the hill, which are great for kids to explore.

Many switchbacks snake up a ridgeline with as many views to the south and west. This section of trail is even steeper and rocky. As the trail progresses up, the rock size increases as well. Eventually, the trail reconnects with the old Abol Trail (put out of commission after extensive damage) at the top of the slide above tree line.
