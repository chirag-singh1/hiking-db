The older trail was rerouted and brought up out of the valley floor to the southern hillside of the adjacent mountains. Deterioration and rutting was a common problem with the older trail, because of its location in the deep valley floor where lots of moisture sets in. The new trail is a welcome treat as it now allows users some brief views of the surrounding landscapes.\r\nThere is an Upper and Lower Trailhead. The Lower Trailhead has a developed parking lot. The Upper Trailhead is located at a wide road junction, with enough room to park a few vehicles.\r\n\nThe trail is a wide-based trail with an average width of approximately three feet. It is made up of dirt with a gravel/rock mixture. It is hard packed during the late spring/early summer season and loosens up a bit during the dryer months of August and September. There can be lots of snow fall in this area so trail use will depend upon the snow fall for that year.  Motorbikes frequent this area.\r\n\nStarting at the lower trailhead is the route of choice.  You can climb up to the Upper Trailhead by either climbing up the trail, or by climbing up Forest Road 437.  If you choose the Road, climb up 437 until you reach Hudlow Saddle. At Hudlow Saddle take a right onto Forest Road 406. Once at the Forest Road 406 /1511 junction look north (to the right) and you'll find the Upper 234 Trailhead.\r\n\nStarting from the Lower Trailhead, the trail crosses Hayden Creek and starts up the Hells Canyon drainage. It starts out as a good climb with a few switchbacks to get you started up the southern, sidehill slope. The trail weaves in and out of small drainages and up and around many ridges. You'll get some good views of the Hells Canyon drainage on this trail which is a huge bonus compared to the older trail.\r\n\nIt only takes about 40 minutes from the city of Coeur d' Alene to get the the Lower Trailhead.

After leaving the road, you'll drop onto the XC ski trails for a little ways. You'll just need to make sure to stay left at any junction, but everything is signed well. Once off the XC ski trails, the trail will continue descending the mountain. At a viewpoint, a trail pops in from the left and then shortly afterwards Sinker Creek Trail peels off on the right. Follow the signs and stay on Eastside. The next junction will be a sharp turn at the DB connector. Turn left and continue down the trail all the way to the creek bottom at Sinker Creek. At this junction follow the signs across the creek and begin climbing out of the drainage. The Eastside Trail then terminates at the Stack Rock Trail.\r\n\nYou can park at the pullouts along the road or at the ski resort and then use the Stack Rock Trail to return to the road at the end of the trail. This trail is also used to connect to Sweet Sweet Coonie or to access Stack Rock. There are no bail out points that take you back to the road until the end of the trail, so please be prepared.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "ratings": {"rating": 5.0, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 6.5, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [6164, 5019], "alt-change": [626, 1400], "avg-grade": 6.0, "max-grade": 20.0}},

Be sure to be on the lookout for short side trails that have bonus waterfalls and tiny unnamed lakes to see. Farley Lake is your halfway up mark. There are tons of camping areas along the trail and around the various lakes. Continue gaining altitude and enjoying the various waterfalls and lakes. Halfway from Farley Lake to Toxaway Lake is the junction of Edith Lake Trail #040 that climbs hard to the right from a clearing with a poorly spelled trail sign. After having a good laugh at the blundered sign stay left to continue on to \"TOXWAY\". Three more small lakes and a final push takes you up into Toxaway Lake! The trail ends where it meets Alice Lake - Redfish Lake Trail #092 just above an excellent camping area complete with sandy beaches below.\r\n\nOnce you arrive at Toxaway Lake, you may want to take a swim out to the island as we did. If you do take the plunge, please be very self-aware and conscience of your hypothermia risks as it is incredibly brisk water and it only gets colder in the middle. We swam as a group and kept close tabs on each other.

Once at the summit the trail leaves the thicker tree cover and will become sandier and looser and then will be steep and loose as you descend back to FS400.\r\n\nLower Section: Mile 8.5 to 14\r\nThe lower section begins with the junction of FS400 and takes you down to the parking lot. This is the most popular section and will have the most hikers. From FS400 there is a short climb and then you'll head into a moderate descent across the ridge and with a quick burst up another hill you begin the steep downhill.  As you come upon the sight of a dirt road you'll hit a short, moderately difficult section and a steep ascent. \r\n\nThis was your final burst uphill. Now you'll cruise downhill through lots of overgrowth and fun turns with a couple of exciting drops. You'll drop into a short 0.1 mile section of road, don't miss the trail sign back to the right and you'll make your way into the valley and do a short flat section back to the car. \r\n\nNote: Many people make a loop climbing up 2.5 miles of highway 55 and turning left at rd. #400.", "features": "Views", "condition": "Unknown"}, "ratings": {"rating": 4.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 14.1, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [7277, 4856], "alt-change": [1506, 3692], "avg-grade": 7.0, "max-grade": 30.0}},

This is a perfect singletrack trail in numerous ways as you meander up the canyon through the pine trees and across small bridges.\r\n\nThe total distance of this trail, one-way, is just over 6 miles. The first 3.14 miles are flat with minimal elevation gain and then the bridge-less creek crossing marks the start of the climbing. Having warmed up, it's time to cool down as you forge the creek that is a river in June and turns to a trickle by the end of the summer. Over the next 3 miles, you'll see incredible sights as you climb higher and higher. Early in the summer, you'll cross Targhee Creek multiple times and your shoes will get wet. You hike parallel to the creek until the 5.87-mile mark where you cut back to the west and make your final climb until you intersect with the Continental Divide Trail that is marked with a sign. This is the turnaround point or if you have not had enough, a crossroads onto endless trails.\r\n\nIf you want to see Clark Lake it is only another quarter mile to the northeast on the Continental Divide Trail.

You may want to consider camping if you plan on hiking the entire trail or adding loops. It has some great, smooth singletrack,  some more rugged sections and some unavoidable steeper climbs.\r\n\nAccess to Big Timber Creek is via the Timber Creek Road #105. This is a rough road so many start their hike closer to the USFS kiosk board near Swan Basin. It is 4.5 miles from the kiosk to the start of the trail (please take this extra milage into consideration when planning your hike).\r\n\nThe official beginning of the trail is at a gate across Big Timber Road just uphill from a shallow stream crossing. It then climbs and follows this road, past another wire gate, about 1/4 mile where a good singletrack bears left away from the road.  \r\n\nThis short trail contours down and rejoins the ATV road before descending steeply to parallel Big Timber Creek. The trail is open to ATVs to the next gate.\r\n\nOnce past the ATV gate, the trail is easy to follow and well defined. The trails beyond this gate are still open to MX bikes so don't be surprised to hear some \"brap.\"  Soon after the gate is a stream crossing. This is Rocky Creek and the Rocky Creek Trail #6184 takes off to the right just after this crossing.  \r\n\nThe trail then follows Big Timber Creek along the valley, climbing gently for about another 4 miles before entering the timber and gaining elevation more quickly. This is a short, wet section of trail near the end of the sage valley in an aspen grove and a little ways above the junction with Cabin Creek Trail.\r\n\nAfter entering the timber, the trail gets much more rugged and climbs close to 2000' to the pass between Big Timber and the Park Fork. Much of this section is open sage meadows mixed with steeper more rugged trail.\r\n\nNear the head of Big Timber Creek, the trail crosses several springs and has been badly washed out. Above the washout, the trail crosses a boggy area then turns and climbs up on a steep bench, passing giant white pine skeletons along the way to the pass.\r\n\nNorth of the pass, at 9700', the trail drops 300' vertical across a rocky scree field. There are some beautifully constructed, terraced switchbacks criss-crossed by dirt-bike shortcuts. This makes for a somewhat exposed descent.\r\n\nBeyond the scree field, the trail rolls and climbs along the edge of the head of the Park Fork of Pahsimeroi's Big Creek to the junction with Rocky Creek Trail #6184 where it ends 11.8 miles in.", "features": "Commonly Backpacked \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Views", "condition": "Unknown"}, "ratings": {"rating": 5.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 11.8, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [9686, 7246], "alt-change": [2857, 844], "avg-grade": 6.0, "max-grade": 30.0}},

This trail has never been officially added to the government trail maps and thus has no maintenance plan. It is, however, somewhat well established with over 150 cairn markers that start on the summit of Lower Cannon Lake Trail #126 just above Lower Cannon Lake. \r\n\nThis trail is quite easy as it runs from cairn to cairn up the ridge. That easy hiking gives way as you start to assault the face of the canyon and climb steeper and steeper. If at anytime you feel like you lost the trail, just stop and scan for a cairn, the trail reappears like magic. (sometimes you wonder how you didn't see it) About 2/3 the way there, the trail plays a bittersweet trick on you, leading you to think you are coming over the top and almost there! It is only a sweet meadow area with a sweet waterfall coming down a sweet cliff! Stay with the cliff as you pass the waterfall and scramble up a steep, somewhat loose trail section to get up out of the meadow area. You are almost there! \r\n\nContinue following the cairns up a steep valley to a great fall camping area and from there down onto the rocky lake shore. Some may stop here, but there is more to see if you continue along the shore to the mouth of the lake and a spectacular view. The trip back down is somehow easier to navigate and much faster.

If you follow the ridge to the east (on the Pilot Peak Summit Spur), you'll find some places for backcountry camping with a beautiful view of the forest to the east. You won't want to miss the panoramic view at Pilot Peak at about 8,000 feet, which is incredible. There is a weather station that shares public information about conditions at the peak (MLLFI1).\r\n\nIf you make the turn-off to Pilot's Peak, make sure you have your bearings about you.

Along the creek runs this easy to follow singletrack trail. With minimal elevation gain, this makes for a great trail for small children or for beginner hikers.\r\n\nTuring off the highway onto the dirt road to the trailhead, you'll drive along a small inlet lake to the Palisades Reservoir that is filled by Big Elk Creek. There is a dock at the inlet lake for swimming, kayaking, canoeing, or even motor boating with access to a boat launch. As you continue to drive on the dirt road, you'll drive through a Forest Service Campground. This makes for a great area to camp before or after your hike. There are reservation and non-reservation campsites for RV\u2019s or tents. $12 is the overnight rate (2017) for a single vehicle and pad site. There is a camp host on site as well with water and maintained outhouse facilities. There is also a public outhouse at the trailhead.\r\n\nThis trail starts off steep for a short 50-yard section and then levels out and meanders up and down, but the climbing is minimal. Early in the year before summer, there is potential for multiple creek crossings. One can stay dry during mid/late summer months. This trail is frequented by horses, so the trail has protruding rocks in some spots. Bikers avoid this narrow trail as you can hike it faster than biking it because of the sometimes rocky terrain. \r\n\nAround 3 miles, you'll pass the Dry Canyon Trail turnoff to the east (right) that is marked with a sign. The Dry Canyon Trail crosses the creek, and this makes for a great turnaround point for small children and also a great little swimming hole. In early summer, the water will be above your waist at this crossing.\r\n\nWhat makes the Big Elk Creek Trail so amazing is the lush undergrowth and large flowing creek. There are spots where the canyon is narrow and other spots where the canyon opens up and provides expansive views of lush hillsides covered in wildflowers. This trail is a hidden gem in Idaho and one that has made \u201ctop 10 little-known trails in Idaho that you should hike\u201d type of lists. This trail branches off at 6 miles and there is posted signage showing the trail changes to the Siddoway Trail and the Big Elk Trail continues across the creek to the east as it travels up the Big Elk North Fork Trail.

Continuing on the actual trail, however, will take you through nice pine forests. The trail weaves its way up a ridge before flattening out a bit. At one point, the trail leads you to an area with a sign that says \"The View\" but Whoopi Goldberg and Joy Behar are nowhere to be found. \r\n\nIt does have some nice benches, birdhouses, and a sign-in book inside a box that has a \"give a treat, take a treat\" policy. It's a great place to take a break. The trail continues until it intersects with the Buck Creek Road, which will lead you up to the Little Piney Road and the Monument Peak area.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7072856/the-view-a-pristine-respite-with-a-serene-vista", "ratings": {"rating": 4.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 1.9, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [7627, 7191], "alt-change": [506, 286], "avg-grade": 8.0, "max-grade": 21.0}},

It is about an hour drive from Atomic City to the base of butte, and in good weather can be done in a two wheel drive car.

In areas the trail is basically non-existent and excellent route finding skills will be paramount in the section from Snake River to the endpoint. Be sure to have the route downloaded to the Hiking Project mobile app and also be prepared for some route deviation since the cattle in the area will tend to move the trail around a little.
