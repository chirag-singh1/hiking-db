Just before the cabins, you'll reach a fork where the right turn heads on River Bank Spur Trail to its terminus and offers good views of Buggs Island Lake.

It's terminus will be passed later in the loop. \r\n\nAfter Robin's Roost Trail, the trail enters deeper into the beech forest and runs parallel but inland from the shoreline.

Most cyclists that see you'll alert you to their presence by saying \"rider up\" and tell you if they have people biking with them \"2 more behind\" or \"just me\" if on a solo ride.)\r\n\nIf you use the side trail, bear right when you meet up with the main trail. You'll pass a rocky part and then head into a new area that has fewer obstacles and two new wooden bridges. A little ways down, the trail forks, if you go right you'll stay on the trail. The left fork crosses Riverside Drive to Forrest Hill Park.\r\n\nBear right to cross a bridge and continue on to Reedy Creek parking lot. Crossing the lot, you'll enter a more difficult part of the trail. Again be aware of other users as this trail curves and there are quite a few hills that make visibility more difficult.\r\n\nAbout a quarter mile from Reedy Creek, you'll encounter stairs and a ramp for bikers. In wet or icy conditions DO NOT use the ramp. I have the bruises to prove what a bad idea this is, even in a drizzle. You pass three creeks on this part of the trail, in addition there are plenty of root obstacles and hills for those trying out a weighted down pack or trail runners looking for a challenge.\r\n\nThe last part of this trail ascends some switchbacks and crosses four more bridges (if you're tired, I like to stretch on the third switchback before a final push up the hill). At the top of the hill, look right to see the Carillon Tower across the river. The trail forks at top of hill; take the left fork to Nickel Bridge or bear right under the bridge (hazardous rocks, be careful!) then follow the trail to reach the left side of Nickel Bridge.\r\n\nCross the bridge to reach parking lots at Dogwood Dell and Byrd Park.", "features": "Fall Colors \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Views", "condition": "All Clear"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7064217/just-the-beginning", "ratings": {"rating": 4.3, "num_reviewers": 7}, "stats": {"dist": 3.3, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [207, 47], "alt-change": [190, 341], "avg-grade": 3.0, "max-grade": 14.0}},

You can choose to hike 3 miles to the Maupin Shelter on the Mau-Har Trail or take the challenge of the summit route by continuing on the AT. This route is 7 miles long and the elevation peaked at 3794' to get to the same Maupin Shelter.  \r\n\nFor our trip, we continued on the AT as it takes a momentary downward projection towards the Harper's Creek Shelter.  This location offers a place to provide your legs some rest before the massive and relentless climb to the summit.  It is also HIGHLY recommended that you use the creek to refill all of your water bottles with water from the creek that runs by the shelter. Be sure to filter/treat any water before drinking!  You may want to utilize the toilet near the shelter, because you'll not see another facility until you get to the Maupin Shelter which is 6 miles away with 2000' of elevation gain.  \r\n\nUpon leaving the Harper's Creek Shelter you are going to climb, climb and climb some more.  At times the trail is pure rock piles or just a large boulder.  The summit doesn't provide views, but the ridges on the way up provide amazing views of the valley and of the \"Priest\" to the south (Flat Rock & Chimney Rocks along the ridges).  Take time to enjoy these views while your thighs take a much needed break.  After many switchbacks on the south side of the mountain, you'll reach the 6 mile mark and the tree covered summit.  Though every book states that there are zero views from the summit, you can gain some views to the north just over the top of the mountain.  The real gem of the trail comes at the 7 mile mark of the trail when you have descended from the summit a mile.  \r\n\nJust off the trail to the left there is an area of large boulders that you can sit on and just relish the fantastic views to the south.  Taking an extended meal break at this location is highly advised. After enjoying the views that this trail is known for, you continue to the 8-9 mile point will reach the Mau-Har Trail junction at the Maupin Shelter.

The western slope of Walker Mountain is in much better shape, and a better hike that avoids the eastern slope can be accomplished by hiking this trail to the ridge of Walker Mountain, hiking south on the old woods road (really now a trail, as the road has been closed for years), and then descending using the Sam Judd Ramsey Trail #660 to the Clayton Mill Road.", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7068355/the-condition-of-the-trail-on-the-western-slope-of-walker-mountain-is-much-bette", "ratings": {"rating": 1.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 3.0, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [3138, 2151], "alt-change": [1037, 1009], "avg-grade": 13.0, "max-grade": 26.0}},

Trail starts at closed road on Big River Road (Va 600).  It passes very near some houses before passing through a pine forest away from development.  Important: shortly after leaving the pine forest, you'll pass between a cut, downed tree.  The trail becomes very hard to follow after that point for a brief distance.  Look to your left - the trail cuts over a small ridge and continues on the south side of the ridge.  It will be out of sight if you continue traveling west towards the slope of Mill Mountain.\r\n\nNice views to the east are had after Mill Mountain is summited.  Hike along the ridge for a while before the trail drops off of the summit towards Ingram Draft.  There are several road crossings and merges in the Draft, so be sure to follow the yellow blazes.\r\n\nAfter Ingram Draft, the trail follows old access road to a fire tower reportedly taken down in the 1950's. Sometimes overgrown. Worth taking, however, as the best views of the entire trail are just before the fire tower. After passing the fire tower's concrete base, the trail drops in elevation.  At the gap between the fire tower summit and the next summit, do not miss where the trail cuts right and skirts the next summit. There is a social trail to that summit and yellow blazes are not clear, so keep an eye out.  \r\n\nThe trail continues to lose elevation as it heads north before rising again briefly and coming to a stone cairn. Follow the blazes to the left to complete this trail, or go right and continue on a de-commissioned trail that continues north to the Sam Judd Ramsey Trail. This de-commissioned trail is in better shape than the still-active Sam Judd Ramsey Trail #660.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7068139/view-to-east-towards-jump-rock-from-opening-along-mill-mtn-trail", "ratings": {"rating": 4.0, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 8.5, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [3095, 1599], "alt-change": [1248, 2028], "avg-grade": 7.0, "max-grade": 24.0}},

The trail leaves the National Forest in its easternmost mile. Although some reports indicate that it continues thanks to an agreement with the landowner, the trail is not marked outside of the National Forest and several roads intersect with the trail, making it impossible to know for sure if you are on an acceptable path. The trail leaves the National Forest right at an elbow curve shown on trail maps, but that section of trail no longer exists. The safest choice is to turn around at the end of the public lands.\r\n\nHeading west from this trail's one road crossing (which is the trailhead for both sections of trail), the Sam Judd Ramsey Trail follows an old road that crosses through an area that has recently been logged on both sides of the trail. The trail crosses three roads, and the third crossing is important - about 100 yards after that crossing, the trail leaves the old road, cuts left, and angles up the mountain. This is not obvious, so if you aren't careful you'll find yourself climbing the mountain on an old road at an insanely steep 33% grade.\r\n\nIf you are looking for the trail from the top of Walker Mountain, load a waypoint in your GPS first - the trail is not marked by a sign. Instead a faded yellow blaze is on a tree and a ribbon may encircle that same tree.  It is not an obvious intersection.\r\n\nThere are no vistas on this trail, though ascending from Sidling Hill there are some nice views of Walker Mountain to the west.", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7068359/looking-eastbound-near-the-summit-of-sideling-hill", "stats": {"dist": 3.0, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [3092, 1623], "alt-change": [1725, 256], "avg-grade": 13.0, "max-grade": 36.0}},

This trail is mostly a rocky fire road that was made long before hiking became popular, and they clearly weren't concerned about making switchbacks to maintain a climbable grade. \r\n\nStart at the intersection with the Blue Ledge Trail and head south along a moderate climb to reach the Blackwell's Trail. Although it's a black diamond trail, taking the Blackwell's Trail cuts off the steepest and most relentless part of climbing on the Little Flat Mountain Loop.\r\n\nI recommend hikers bypass this section unless you're looking for the physical challenge. There isn't anything technical, but the grade is incredibly steep. Hiking up Blackwell's Trail is a much better option.\r\n\nFrom the upper intersection with the Blackwell's Trail to the top of the park's highest point is a fun challenge. It's uphill the whole time, but there are three major climbs. At the top of the third climb you'll find yourself at the very top of the park!\r\n\nJust as you start downhill you'll find a beautiful overlook. There's a bench and an amazing view of the mountainous terrain in this area. This is a great place to stop and eat before you start the downhill part of the trail. \r\n\nThis is where all of the climbing you just endured truly pays off. Continuing clockwise on the Little Flat Mountain Loop, you'll be served some enjoyable downhill singletrack to reward you for your earlier efforts. \r\n\nHikers will soon come to the picnic area and the first of three descent options. The first option is to hang a left on the rocky singletrack of the Crooked Tree Trail. Or, continue straight through the picnic area and start on a new section of wide machine cut trail which then returns to rocky steep fire road.

The Little Devils Stairs Trailhead is well marked, making it difficult to miss. \r\n\nThe Trail: The trail is located on the right side of the Keyser Run parking area, marked with blue blazes. The initial mile of the trail is relatively gentle, but don't let it fool you. The grade picks up significantly for the second half of the climb.\r\n\nLittle Devils Stairs follows Keyser Run and makes 11 major crossings of the stream. In the fall, these stream crossings are often made challenging by high water. Trekking poles are recommended for balance.\r\n\nThe final stream crossing will put visitors on the left-hand side of the stream. At this point, the trail switch-backs several times up the slope and flattens out. At the two mile mark, the trail ends at an intersection with Keyser Run Road. Looping down Keyser Run Road for 3.5 miles to the parking lot is the recommended return route.\r\n\nHighlights: Multiple waterfalls along Keyser Run make for nice photo opportunities. The best water is available in the stream during the spring and fall seasons.\r\n\nStone walls are visible along the right side of the trail near the beginning. These walls belonged to the original property owners prior to the establishment of the national park and mark property boundaries.\r\n\nHalfway into the trail, hikers will find themselves inside a large gorge with a scree field on the left and a sheer cliff with a water seep on the right. This scenery is unique to Shenandoah whose trails typically traverse a series of hilly spurs and draws. The gorge was created by the erosion of a subterranean geological fault that formed millions of years ago. The basalt columns on the right and the eroded scree on the left are almost 600 million years old and are some of the oldest stones in SNP. The cliff faces on the right occasionally freeze during the winter and provide ice climbing opportunities for well-equipped climbers.\r\n\nSeason: LDS is navigable during all seasons. Fall provides foliage, winter provides views when the leaves are down, spring offers reasonable stream crossings and pleasant temperatures, and summer heat provides the greatest challenge.", "features": "Fall Colors \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Spring \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Waterfall", "condition": "All Clear"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7014477/couldnt-walk-for-a-couple-of-days-afterwards-but-boy-was-it-worth-every-step-oct", "ratings": {"rating": 4.5, "num_reviewers": 21}, "stats": {"dist": 2.0, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [2726, 1267], "alt-change": [1459, 0], "avg-grade": 14.0, "max-grade": 36.0}},

The blue-blazed, Piney Ride Trail heads south from the end of the Range View Cabin Road. \r\n\nThe trail goes along near the crest of the ridge for a few miles. The tread is fairly smooth compared to some of the other trails in the area. \r\n\nMost of the trees along this trail are black locust, pine, and a few other pioneer species. When the park was established, this area was used as a goat pasture, with only a few trees left for shade. Since that time many pine trees have grown along the trail. Most of them are younger than the park and much younger than the name of the ridge.\r\n\nA little less than two miles from the start of the trail, look for the Dwyer family cemetery off in the woods, a couple hundred feet to the right.

(Note: If you hike out and back, the entire round-trip is around 6.25 miles and 1,230 vertical feet.) The first two miles are a green/blue easy hike while the last mile contains most of the vertical, and some short pitches into the blue/black range (between 10-20% grade).\r\n\nThis is a lightly trafficked trail, so even on a beautiful fall weekend when Shenandoah NP campgrounds are sold out, you're likely to be alone on the trail. You may not be rid of road noise though, as much of the trail is near Skyline Drive. Bright yellow blazes and a visible singletrack make the trail easy to follow despite being mostly covered in leaves or vegetation. A word of caution in wet conditions\u2014this trail may be hazardous in spots due to its shape and the ground composition.\r\n\nStart your journey at the well marked trailhead at the SW corner of the 8-car capacity Hull School parking lot. The singletrack starts with 0.4 miles of rolling terrain through a thick tunnel of vegetation about 10-12 feet tall. At the 0.4 mile mark, you'll cross over the AT (if you take a right down the AT from here it is a short walk to the Beams Gap Overlook parking, an alternate if Hull School parking is full).  \r\n\nFrom 0.5 to 0.75 miles, you'll see Skyline Dr. on your right and a gentle upslope to the left. This area is a lovely open forest with rolling terrain and sun filtering through the trees on a nice day. At 0.75 mi, begin a gentle upward slope and eventually, you'll cross a tiny drainage stream at 1 mi. At the highest point in the trip, about 1.25 mi, we discovered a shout here would bounce off the trees and echo in the forest. At 1.5 mi, begin the gentle slope down until 1.7 mi where the slope steepens slightly while traversing a few log steps. At 1.8 mi, cross a spring (sometimes dry). At 2 mi you'll cross Skyline Drive.\r\n\nThe trail west of Skyline Dr. is different from the first two miles on the east side. The pitch drops immediately across the road where pine trees and small rocks begin to dot the trail, which gently descends until about mile 2.4. At this point, the trail is U-shaped and looks like it provides drainage during periods of heavy rain as it meanders down consistently steep pitches of the hillside before leveling off at 2.8 miles. The last 0.4 mi is an easy hike along a grassy trail to the park boundary overlooking a small lake on private land.", "features": "Fall Colors", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7038001/rocky-branch-trail-yellow-blazes", "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 3.2, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [2762, 1839], "alt-change": [295, 961], "avg-grade": 8.0, "max-grade": 26.0}},

This first portion of the descent is fairly moderate, though you'll notice the elevation loss. \r\n\nAfter about three-quarters of a mile, visitors will reach the Tuscarora-Overall Run Access Trail that connects to the Traces Trail that loops around Matthews Arm Campground. Stay to the right, heading east and north, passing the junction with Matthews Arm Trail, that comes in from the left after a little over two miles from the start. \r\n\nFrom here, visitors will continue their descent as it becomes gradually steeper, heading toward Overall Run Falls. Shortly, there will be a viewpoint to the left (west) of the trail. This small detour is worthwhile, as the views of the falls are spectacular here! Though the Overall Run Falls don't plunge straight down, the sound that the water makes as it tumbles from rock to rock is soothing and beautiful. The total drop is still an impressive 93 feet, though depending on the season, the falls might be dry. \r\n\nAfter you enjoy your time at the falls, the trail continues to lose elevation. There is a steep portion just after the falls, as visitors will descend to and then cross a stream. The trail levels out after the stream crossing, and opens up into a scenic hollow. Take some time to explore here, or begin your return journey. \r\n\nThough the descent is fun and quick, remember that it will be tough work to ascend back to the camping area.

Stay straight on the South River Falls Trail as it leads to an observation point down on the right, toward the falls. Look for the ledge surrounded by a constructed guard wall. \r\n\nFrom here, you'll find the best views of the falls, out toward the gorge, and the northeast ridge of Saddleback Mountain beyond. The trail continues down where it ends at the South River Falls Road.  \r\n\nThanks to Larry W. Brown, for sharing this description.

Be aware as there are a couple rough stretches, but if you want to escape from the crowds, this is one of the better options in the park that is still easily accessible.\r\n\nBecause this is a one-way hike, you'll either have to leave a car at the bottom of the trail, plan for someone to meet you there, or use the trail as an out-and-back hike (doubling the distance to six miles). \r\n\nTo get to the eastern end of the trail, from Thornton Gap at mile 31.5, take U.S. 211 east toward Washington. Continue 3.7 miles to a small parking area off to the right. Look for the Buck Hollow Trail marked by a concrete post.\r\n\nFrom the trailhead off of Skyline Drive, the trail dives gradually at the beginning, then continues to gain in grade with some steep sections. The trail passes through a young forest of mostly mountain laurel, which is very nice to stroll through. Keep your eyes open for some dead hemlocks, many of which were destroyed by the hemlock wooly adelgid.\r\n\nAbout three-quarters of a mile from Skyline Drive, the trail bends to the right and crosses a rocky stream bed before descending along the ridge some distance from the stream. Further along, it bends back to the left, descends to the stream, and makes a sharp right. \r\n\nFrom here, watch for the blue blazes. After another quarter-mile, the trail turns left and crosses the stream, but this turn is often missed. Look out for the blue blazes! A double blaze means that the trail is about to change direction. If you think you may have missed the turn and are running out of trail, cross back to the left bank of the stream and you'll find the trail there, within a hundred feet of the water.\r\n\nFor a large stretch of the trail, you'll follow an old road that originally went to a sawmill further up in the hollow. Look out for these occasional traces of old logging road that join the trail, keeping with the blue blazes. \r\n\nThe park and Potomac Appalachian Trail Club trail crews have done thorough work in this area. The trail crosses the stream again and after another quarter of a mile leaves the old dirt road to become much smoother and narrower. The trail quickly crosses the Buck Hollow stream for the last time, then crosses the Thornton River. Both crossings are fairly easy unless the water is high from recent rains. \r\n\nAfter this last crossing, the parking area at U.S. 211 is less than 200 yards away, through what was once a grassy clearing near an old homesite.\r\n\nThanks to Larry W.

Around a half-mile from the start, the trail bends to the left and drops the side of the ridge for a couple hundred yards, before it turns to the right beside an ephemeral stream.

There are ruins of several small farm buildings, old grape vines, and piles and walls of rock.

This is Hogcamp Branch, which drains Big Meadows Swamp and becomes the principal tributary of Rose River.\r\n\nThe trail descends easily for 0.6 mile to the head of the falls. You must stay on the trail here. There's no view from the top of the falls, and the rocks there are slippery and dangerous. The trail swings away from the stream and goes uphill for a few feet before swinging right and descending to the base of the falls. On the trail between the top and bottom of the falls, you'll pass a tremendous rock that looms on your left, just where the trail swings sharply to the right. Except in dry summer months, water constantly trickles and drips down the face of this rock, promoting the growth of mosses, ferns, and liverworts. On cold winter days there's an enchanting display of stalactites and stalagmites of ice.\r\n\nThere's a fine view of the falls from the bottom. The water drops 70 feet, in a series of cascades, over the crumbling greenstone of an ancient lava flow.\r\n\nBelow the falls, the trail descends another 145 feet in about 300 yards to the Rose River Fire Road, passing a number of small cascades, and then intersecting with a small waterfall that some call the lower Dark Hollow Falls. \r\n\nYou can return by the way you came, or cross the Rose River Fire Road and access the Rose River Loop Trail to explore further.\r\n\nThanks to Larry W.

It falls along the ridge top with a couple switchbacks, and has a nicer tread than most of the blue-blazed trails. For a stretch of this hike, you can see the results of the 2000 fires. Around a half a mile from the start, at the right side of the trail, is a pretty unusual \"deer\" tree - a result of damage that occurred a few years ago during an ice storm. The trail continues downhill, with a few brief and easy climbs to head around two knobs on the ridge crest.\r\n\nAfter about a mile from Skyline Drive, at a concrete marker post, the Hannah Run Trail bends ninety degrees to the right, at the junction with the Catlett Mtn Trail. Up to now, the trail has been fairly new and is periodically cleared for park visitors. Heading further, however, the trail transitions back into an old mountain trail, leading to the first homesite and then what used to be a road.\r\n\nAfter you turn right at the junction, the trail is almost level until it begins to descend, gradually and then much more steeply. The next few hundred yards are steep and slippery. Descend to Hannah Run and then ascend the ridge on the other side. Go around forty yards more, and look out for the piles of stones off to the right. These are all that remains of an early building here.\r\n\nAfter another forty yards, the trail makes a quick left turn, at the corner of another former homesite. Similarly to the first, all that remains is the stone foundation.\r\n\nThe next former homesite (lost in a fire) is two-tenths of a mile further, off to the left. It's smaller and older than the first. After another couple hundred yards, look for the third and oldest ruin. Only the chimney and some stones from the foundation remain.\r\n\nFrom here, it becomes more apparent that the trail follows an old road. There are numerous piles of rocks on both sides of the trail that mark locations of previous fences, outbuildings, and homes. This is a delightful stroll as the surrounding woods are open with views and some good sized trees. Hannah Run is down a small ravine on your left.

Continue next to the road, keeping to the right where it forks. The Passamaquoddy Trail - South crosses the road around two-tenths of a mile from the parking area. Turn right on the trail, heading north, and continue for about two-tenths of a mile to a dirt road, and turn right. \r\n\nPass a seldom used side road that climbs uphill to the right, and continue to a fork in the road. The right fork goes fifty yards to a no-longer-used pump house, while the left fork, with a yellow chain, is the old Skyland Road, which provided access to Skyland before Skyline Drive was built. \r\n\nThe Passamaquoddy Trail - North resumes on the far side of the road, at a concrete marker post. Fifty yards from the marker, the enclosed pump house at Furnace Spring is set into the hillside on the right. This spring once provided water to a copper smelter, giving the spring its name.\r\n\nThe 0.8-mile section of trail between Furnace Spring and Little Stony Man is the original Passamaquoddy Trail.  In 1932, George Freeman Pollock, the owner of Skyland, had a trail built between these points. A number of traces of the old trail can still be seen just a few feet up the bank. Pollock called this the Passamaquoddy Trail because, he said, Passamaquoddy is a Maine Indian word meaning \"abounding in pollock\" (an abundant saltwater fish on the Maine coast).\r\n\nThe trail continues, with some ups and downs, along the steep slope below the Stony Man cliffs. Less than half a mile beyond the spring, where the trail is wide and nearly level, look for the big overhanging rocks to the right. In wet weather they trickle, and in winter they are usually covered with icicles. The Stony Man Cliffs are immediately up the slope, towering above you.

When water levels are sufficient, the pure wilderness scenery and abundant flowing streams along this trail is spectacular in any season.\r\n\nThe beginning of this trail is at the intersection of a foot trail and horse trail combined (see Skyland-Big Meadows Horse Trail). The horse trail turns off to the left, while the loop trail continues straight ahead on the blue-blazed trail.\r\n\nA hundred yards beyond, the Rose River comes down on the left and parallels the trail. As you go, the stream is rarely out of sight, and it has an endless variety of cascades and pools. After another quarter of a mile you're at the upper Rose River falls, which consist of several separate cascades. Just below the upper falls, off the trail, you can opt to walk down steeper terrain into a rock gorge, where the lower Rose River falls will come into view from your left.\r\n\nContinuing along the trail after leaving the waterfalls, you'll descend to flatter terrain. The trail will now parallel another stream, to your left, named Hogcamp Branch, which drains Big Meadows Swamp, and flows through Dark Hollow, then becomes the principal tributary of Rose River. \r\n\nFurther along the trail you'll approach the filled-in shaft of an old copper mine, to its left is a weathered concrete block; it supported an air compressor that supplied the pneumatic drills. Less than a tenth of a mile beyond the copper mine, cross the foot bridge over Hogcamp Branch and turn right. The trail ascends through lower Dark Hollow and reaches the Rose River fire road after 0.9 mile of climbing.\r\n\nWhen you reach the fire road, turn right and cross the bridge, where to your left is a long, narrow waterfall which descends from Dark Hollow Falls. Thirty yards beyond the bridge, the blue-blazed Dark Hollow Falls Trail goes uphill on the left. If you make a side trip to the base of these falls you'll add 0.3 mile and 145 feet of climbing to your trip.\r\n\nContinue uphill on the fire road back to Fishers Gap Overlook, about 1.1 miles from the bridge.\r\n\nThanks to Larry W.

As you might expect, this has always been one of the most popular places in Shenandoah. On summer weekends you'll find the parking area full and the canyon crowded.\r\n\nThe trail, from the Skyline Drive to the first (and tallest) waterfall, is in good condition, and rather easy. But further down it gets steeper, and parts of it are rough and rocky. Please note that, like most waterfall trails starting from the Skyline Drive, you have an easy downhill jaunt, but the work comes on the way back up to your starting point. Remember when you descend into the canyon, you still have to work your way back up.\r\n\nThe trail starts gently downhill, swinging first right and then left around a swampy area. Cross a small stream and, 0.6 mile from the start, cross the Old Rag Fire Road. After another quarter of a mile you'll cross the Limberlost Accessible Trail. After a couple of hundred yards a small stream comes in from the right and flows beside the trail. \r\n\nContinue, downward. Pass cascades and pools, cliffs and ledges and surrealistic boulders. Then, a mile and a third from the Limberlost Trail, you come to another trail junction with a concrete marker post. The trail turns left here, crosses the stream on a bridge, and then continues downstream on the left bank to where the trail widens. 30 yards farther, a horse trail comes in on the left, and the Whiteoak Fire Road to the right. Continue straight ahead to another widening in the trail. Diagonally ahead to the right are two rocky ledges. From the downstream ledge you have a fine view of the upper falls.\r\n\nContinue, downward. Below the upper falls the canyon is narrow, and the trail is steep and rough. If you take the Whiteoak Canyon Trail all the way to the bottom, you'll reach a parking area in Berry Hollow, where most folks begin the Whiteoak Canyon to Cedar Run Loop. You can opt to continue on to the Cedar Run Trail from here, which will take you back to your original starting point at Skyline Drive.\r\n\nThanks to Larry W.

But there's more!  \r\n\nTo the left of the sign, go upstream a few steps, cross the stream past a post with a sign warning not to drink the water, and head down a short, steep, rocky trail notable for a sturdy steel pipe railing, hanging on to prevent falling.  At the end of the steel pipe you reach the lower viewing area.  This observation area is bounded by a  circular stone wall, where you can start to get a decent view of the falls.  You cannot see all the way to the bottom of the falls due to overgrowth, but the view of the upper portion is worth the effort.  This is a good spot to relax and have a snack before beginning the uphill journey back.\r\n\nRetrace your way back up the spur trail to the first post noted above, and take the sharp right turn on the Lewis Falls Trail, heading up the hill.  After several switchbacks, there is a fake left turn, but head up to the right, then turn left on the AT.  Follow the AT back to the access trail, going uphill past a spectacular viewpoint, then downhill, passing the beginning of the Lewis Falls Trail on the left, then turning right on the access trail back to the parking lot by the Amphitheatre.\r\n\nLewis Falls has a reputation for not having much flow during dry seasons.", "features": "Views \u00b7 Waterfall", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7013979/winter-view-of-lewis-spring-falls-as-seen-from-the-viewing-platform", "ratings": {"rating": 3.3, "num_reviewers": 3}, "stats": {"dist": 3.2, "dist-type": "Loop", "alt-range": [3669, 2831], "alt-change": [1015, 1027], "avg-grade": 12.0, "max-grade": 36.0}},

In winter, but not in summer, there are occasional good views across Two Mile Run to Two Mile Ridge. A few yards short of the summit is your destination. From there you can climb to a rock with a fine view of Two Mile Ridge to Rocky Mountain and, farther left, to the Blue Ridge and a part of Skyline Drive and enjoy your well-earned views.\r\n\nFrom the summit, the trail continues on a steady descent along the ridge to its junction with the Gap Run Trail near Gap Run.

The trail continues to Chimney Rock.\r\n\nFrom Chimney Rock, after around three-quarters of a mile, the trail bends to the left and begins to drop into Cold Spring Hollow. A little more than a mile further and a stream merges in from the left, and the trail joins Riprap Hollow. One hundred feet downstream is a small but very picturesque cascade.\r\n\nThe trail crosses the stream and continues for another hundred yards until a side trail heads off to the right, crossing the stream toward the Riprap Shelter site, which is next to one of the biggest swimming holes in the park. The Riprap Shelter no longer exists, as it was removed when the area became a wilderness. From the shelter site, you can continue downstream for a couple hundred feet to merge back onto the trail. \r\n\nA short distance ahead the trail forks. Bear right, heading along the relocated trail as it stays on higher ground that avoids flood damage. The trail continues for another half-mile or so until the intersection with the Wildcat Ridge Trail. The Riprap Trail continues for three-quarters of a mile to the western limit of the park.\r\n\nThanks to Larry W. Brown, for sharing this trail description.

You can see the trailhead from the parking lot (Lot B). It makes a great short hike, or a quick warm-up to start your day. You're going to be following green blazes on the trees (most of them are shaped like little trees, because it's just delightful like that).\r\n\nTrue to the name, this trail was sponsored by the Blue Ridge chapter of the Society of American Foresters, and so there's a large sign immediately at the mouth of the trail off the parking lot. There's also a mailbox right there with trail maps if you'd like one, and if it's empty, you can find maps in the explore center just across the road near the other parking lot (the explore center has a couple drinking fountains if you need water and clean restrooms as well).\r\n\nThere will be a fork very near the opening where you can choose to go to the 1994 clearing or around on the self-guided trail. This track follows the self-guided trail. It's called self-guided because, shortly after you begin, you'll start seeing the little plaques on some of the larger, more representative trees along the trail. Enjoy reading about the trees on the path as you go!\r\n\nWhile the majority of the trail is relatively level, there are some areas with a steeper grade. You'll cross roots on the path along the way. Be aware of your footing, don't feel the need to rush, and it should be no trouble as a fun outing in the woods. The trail is well-kept and wide enough to be comfortable.\r\n\nYou're also going to be far enough away from the road that it's quiet. I took it on a sunny, humid, late-May day, and the shade from trees and greenery kept it cool. Do remember bug spray if gnats bother you, but I forgot it and didn't have an issue.\r\n\nAnd when you've finished this trail, Explore Park has not just a handful of other neat trails to hike or bike as you prefer, but access to the Roanoke River on the head of the River Walk Trail, a historic walking area, and multiple scenic outlooks nearby on the Roanoke River Parkway and nearby Blue Ridge Parkway.\r\n\nFor more information, Explore Park's website is here, with a link to their trail maps.", "features": "Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "ratings": {"rating": 5.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 0.6, "dist-type": "Loop", "alt-range": [1089, 1001], "alt-change": [110, 112], "avg-grade": 7.0, "max-grade": 18.0}},

It's $3 for the day pass at this spot, but be aware that Explore Park is undergoing a number of improvements, and this might increase between 2018-2019. You can learn more about those improvements along the trail.\r\n\nSecond thing to note is that the lot is relatively small. I recommend either carpooling or, if this lot is full, parking at one of the other lots by Old Salem Turnpike trail, which connects to (and overlaps with) this trail for a little while. Those lots are also free!\r\n\nThis trail feels a bit less managed than some of the others in this park. First, you're following the blue blazes but occasionally, you'll see a red blaze, suggesting that perhaps they changed the color at one point. The first quarter or so of the trail is a bit narrow and brushy, so be prepared to duck under a branch or two. You'll parallel the river the whole way, and all along the route are rough dirt access points if you'd like to go fishing.\r\n\nYou'll also see signs advertising the renovations they're doing (particularly along the waterway) as part of the Adventure Plan. The park and the trails are all still open, but be aware that there might be the occasional construction vehicle trundling along on its way to shoring up part of the trail. If you're local and interested in what they've got planned, you can find out more about on their website.\r\n\nAfter that initial brushy section, though, the trail opens up to a more comfortable width with a relatively flat trail. There are multiple access points to the Historic Area if you're interested in exploring more. Further along, where you overlap with Old Salem Turnpike (red blazes), the trail is quite wide and flat, with packed gravel. If you'd like to enter and exit at this point, do note that the OST trail near this point does have a pretty long and steep road up to the parking lot, but it is paved and easy to navigate.\r\n\nKeep going toward the end and you'll pass the trailhead for the Deer Run Trail, which itself has the trailhead for the Turkey Scratch Loop and the Palmer's Pond connector back to Old Salem Turnpike.\r\n\nIn addition to listening to the river, you'll probably hear a train passing across the water!", "features": "River/Creek \u00b7 Views", "condition": "Unknown"}, "ratings": {"rating": 4.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 1.8, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [952, 823], "alt-change": [212, 99], "avg-grade": 3.0, "max-grade": 10.0}},

Be aware of the slope! You'll start out hiking downhill and end heading uphill. There's plenty of room to pull off the trail if you need a breather, but if you take your time, it shouldn't be too taxing for anyone who is comfortable in the woods. If you choose to start at Lot D, the last hill up to Lot A from where it breaks off the overlapping River Walk Trail does certainly feel steeper going up than it did coming down. Having taken this one both ways, I think I prefer A to D.\r\n\nAs you come around about a quarter of the way into the trail, you'll see yellow blazes heading off to Palmer's Pond Trail. If you're on Old Salem Turnpike to enjoy the leisurely stroll on a wide, mostly paved surface, be advised that Palmer's Pond, while rewarding, is completely different: it's a connector to Deer Run Trail, and both are much more rugged. Palmer's Pond can get steep and has some narrow dirt switchbacks and tall steps. If you're unsure of your footing, I suggest following Old Salem Turnpike. You'll get to enjoy the waterfront views after the downward climb, when it parallels the Roanoke River along the River Walk Trail.

As you leave Blacksburg, you'll drive up a large mountain and as you come down the backside be in the left lane. At the bottom, turn left to access Pandapas Pond. Make an immediate left into the main parking lot (for bikes, horses, etc.) or continue straight to access the Pandapas Pond day-use picnic area and restroom facilities (no bike/horses allowed).\r\n\nThe trail is multi-use and is great for hiking, running, horseback riding, mountain biking, or just enjoying a picnic at the Pandapas Pond day area. The trail is an out-and-back, which means that you can turn around whenever you want. The trail is 7.1 miles one way. By accessing the trails that branch off of Poverty Creek Trail, you can can easily spend an entire day making various loops in this trail system. \r\n\nPoverty Creek Trail (marked with orange blazes) is the main trail at Pandapas Pond that runs along the valley floor and is one of the easier trails in the trail system at least until its intersection with Trillium Trail 4.25 miles from the Upper Parking Lot.  The trail has many rolling slopes, though runs generally downhill, at least until it crosses over FS Rd 708 and intersects with the Trillium Trail.  After that intersection, the trail climbs for around 300' before eventually dumping out on FS Rd 708.  From here you can either return the way you came or run FS Rd 708 in either direction.  \r\n\nFor loop planning purposes, starting from the Upper Parking Lot, you'll intersect the:\r\nWoods & Field Trail at 0.7 miles\r\nWetlands & Pond Trail at 0.8 miles\r\nJoe Pye Trail at 0.85 miles\r\nRoyale Trail at 1.2 miles\r\nSnake Root Trail at 1.45 miles\r\nMay Apple Trail at 2.45 miles\r\nJacobs Ladder Trail at 2.55 miles\r\nQueen Anne Trail at 2.9 miles\r\nTrillium Trail at 4.25 miles\r\nIndian Pipe Trail at 5.2 miles\r\n\nThis is a shared trail with mountain bikers and horses. Keep a heads up and the earbuds out to listen for mountain bikers speeding down the hills.

The trail consists of a singletrack with no actual overlooks. While hiking this trail, you'll be under the canopy of the trees, which makes it a good option for hot, sunny days. There is no water access along this particular trail, but the footing is very good with some smaller rocks and a steady uphill grade. It is definitely a well-traveled and maintained trail. \r\n\nThere are quite a few rhododendron plants growing along the trail, and when they are flowering, they make it a very pretty hike. Upon reaching the forest road at the top of the ridgeline, the Horse Nettle Trail turns right onto the forest road. You'll see occasional blue blazes as the dirt/gravel road rolls up and down (mainly up) along the ridge. You'll know that you are nearing the end of the first road section when you see the radio tower on your left.  \r\n\nA few hundred yards past the radio tower will be a \"roundabout\" parking/camping area with an information board.  The Horse Nettle Trail returns to singletrack just to the left of the information board. The trail generally gently goes downhill to its junction with the Snake Root Trail. To stay on the Horse Nettle Trail, take a left at this junction.  This will take you back to the ridgeline dirt/gravel road, and you'll roll up and down (mainly down) to the junction with the Gateway/Old Farm Trail on the left. \r\n\nJust after this junction the Horse Nettle Trail will turn off the road on the right and turn to singletrack for a hundred yards or so at its terminus with the junction of the Jacobs Ladder Trail. Taking either the Snake Root Trail or Jacobs Ladder Trail will allow you to complete a loop hike back to the Upper Parking Lot via the Poverty Creek Trail. \r\n\nThis is a shared trail with mountain bikers and horses.

The direction that makes the most intuitive sense or flow would be to start at the Wetlands & Pond Trail and ascend to the intersection with the Joe Pye Trail. \r\n\nThe Larkspur Trail is not blazed and is not signed at its intersection with the Wetlands & Pond Trail. The start of the trail is at the only picnic table on the south side of Pandapas Pond. The lower section of the trail is not open to mountain bikers or horses and receives less upkeep, so don't be surprised to duck under branches and hop over downed logs.  You'll soon reach the intersection with the Joe Pye Trail. Again, there is not a Larkspur Trail sign pointing to the pond, though if you take a left onto Joe Pye Trail, you'll immediately see a Larkspur sign on your left, and the trail heads up on your left towards Lady Slipper 0.1 miles away. \r\n\nThe singletrack weaves upward through roots and rocks to its junction with the Lady Slipper Trail. From the junction, take a left to return to the Wetlands & Pond Trail and Pandapas Pond or take a hard right to ascend up to the aforementioned 4-way intersection with Horse Nettle Trail and Joe Pye Trail. If coming down Lady Slipper Trail from the 4-way, keep your eyes peeled for the Larkspur/Lady Slipper sign on the right of the trail with the trail starting with a sharp left that is easy to miss if traveling fast down Lady Slipper Trail.  \r\n\nThe upper portion is a shared trail with mountain bikers and horses.

The grade is generally gentle, the forest is beautiful, the trail weaves alongside and across Little Dry Run, and it is the sole trail to cut through the Little Dry Run Wilderness.  The trail is also open to horseback riders and unfortunately that has led to some areas that have gotten wide and muddy with deep hoofprints to negotiate. It is their right to use and enjoy the trail just as much as anyone else, but this trail could use some trail work to repair muddy sections, reroutes, and areas where the trail has become a bog where people and horses have traversed the mud instead of going right through it which offers the least damage.  \r\n\nYou can start from the shared trailhead with the superb trailwork of Henley Hollow Trail #306 on Hwy 21 a few miles south of Speedwell. Cross to the west side of the highway and follow the trail alongside and across the creek at times. The trail generally has a slight and gentle uphill for the first 2.5 miles. At this point, the trail starts to gain elevation as it switchbacks to a junction with the VA Highland Horse Trail. The gently-graded and doubletrack VA Highlands Horse Trail going to the left (east) will take you back to Hwy 21 a few miles south of the trailhead. Going to the right on the VA Highlands Horse Trail (west) will take you toward Hale Lake and in the general direction of Grayson Highlands. To stay on the Little Dry Run Trail continue straight. The trail looks steep uphill when viewed from this junction, but it soon mellows out.  \r\n\nAfter leveling, the trail starts to climb again before intersecting with the Iron Mountain Trail: Comers Rock Section and the Comers Rock Overlook Trail (worth the side jaunt!) as well as the Comer Rock Camping area. The camping area and Overlook Trailhead offer alternative trailheads at the southern end of the Little Dry Run Trail. The upper section of Little Dry Run Trail south of the VA Highlands Horse Trail does not have the horse hoof damage to the trail or mud that the lower section has, though it is steeper. \r\n\nThis is a shared trail with other hikers and horses. When encountering a horse, it is proper etiquette to step off the trail to the downhill side and stop until the horse has passed. Also, be sure to wear bright colors during hunting season (October 1st through the first week of January).

The Potomac Appalachian Trail Club maintains the Gerhard Shelter, a backpacking shelter that sits in a low flat of the ridge. It makes a great place for a lunch stop, and a trail descending east (Trail 902, Gerhard Shelter Trail on the USFS map), offers a quick bailout to Forest Road 93 for those looking for a shorter hike.\r\n\nSeveral steep pitches littered with rocks await as you climb back up the ridge, but the reward is a long, gradual, rocky descent that dumps you into the first in a series of switchbacks that will require you to dismount in spots. The trail ultimately connects with Waite's Run Road on the West Virginia side of the mountain. \r\n\nOverall, this trail is an incredible challenge that combines the rock moves of Fort Valley and Elizabeth Furnace Figure 8 with the elevation and steeps of the Northern Traverse truly expert level terrain surprisingly close to the DC Metro area.", "features": "Views", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7037737/a-sample-of-the-great-views-waiting-on-tuscarora-county-line-trail", "ratings": {"rating": 4.0, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 8.2, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [2775, 1606], "alt-change": [1126, 1654], "avg-grade": 6.0, "max-grade": 28.0}},

Built by volunteers from local IMBA Chapter MORE and BLM staff working together, South Branch was the first singletrack trail constructed at Meadowood. It is accessible via three trailheads, the primary one at the Mason Neck Gateway kiosk on Gunston Road, and two satellite lots on Old Colchester Road and Belmont Boulevard.\r\n\nSouth Branch's rolling singletrack winds through mature hardwood forests along the sides of the South Branch of Massey Creek's stream valley. Expect tight turns, mellow berms, grade reversals, and wooden boardwalks over floodplains and wetlands. South Branch is a great hike on it's own, and is the perfect place for all levels of hiker to increase their off-road skills before tackling some of the area's more technical trails.\r\n\nHiking clockwise, hikers face a sustained climb out of the South Branch stream valley, and short, rolling downhills. Counterclockwise, the long (for Fairfax!) descent to the stream valley is your reward for tackling the numerous short climbs back to the ridge.\r\n\nSouth Branch holds up well to moderate precipitation but is prone to the freeze-thaw cycle in the winter months. Please be mindful of trail closures posted on the BLM or MORE's  (the local mountain bike club that maintains the trail) website, at the trailheads, or at the kiosks along the South Branch Loop.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "All Clear"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7053990/boardwalk-spanning-the-flood-plain-of-massey-creek-on-the-south-branch-loop", "ratings": {"rating": 4.3, "num_reviewers": 8}, "stats": {"dist": 3.6, "dist-type": "Loop", "alt-range": [146, 11], "alt-change": [281, 290], "avg-grade": 3.0, "max-grade": 9.0}},

The FCPA makes it easy to follow the twisty trail.\r\n\nThe Pimmit Run Trail begins at Great Falls St., just north of Kirby Road. This first short section is a fun warm-up for what is to come, with some turns and narrow sections right above the stream. Crossing Westmoreland St., you start the main event. The trail here is flat and will inspire thoughts of the Creek Trail at Wakefield Park. Be conscious of other trail users, as the trail is popular with mountain bikers, dog walkers and other local residents. This section ends with a run up to Old Dominion Road, be careful as you climb past the small staircase.\r\n\nAfter crossing Old Dominion, turn right on the bike path and left at the trail sign. This will bring you to the first crossing of Pimmit Run. A bit further through bamboo forests will bring you to the final road crossing at Chesterbrook Rd.\r\n\nCross the road and turn right, then left to the next stream crossing and a wide field section. The final stream crossing is at the end of the field. Cross the stream and turn left. All of a sudden, the houses that have lined the trails are pushed back, and the stream buffer zone widens. You'll find yourself wondering if you are 10 minutes from the Capitol, or out in the National Forest. The trail becomes rockier and more technical, with a short, ledgy bench cut section. Crossing the floodplain, there are numerous roots and logs to keep you on your toes. Take your final right at the star-shaped blaze and exit the trail onto Bryan Branch Road.\r\n\nThis trail entry represents the western portion of the trail. The eastern portion picks up at the Marie Butler-Leven Preserve off of Kirby Road. The first portion of the eastern segment is on Fairfax County Park Authority land (frequently overgrown), while the majority of the eastern segment is on National Park Service lands administered by the George Washington Parkway.", "condition": "Unknown"}, "ratings": {"rating": 3.2, "num_reviewers": 5}, "stats": {"dist": 4.3, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [360, 185], "alt-change": [19, 186], "avg-grade": 1.0, "max-grade": 6.0}},

A great after-work hike contained entirely within the park is to link the two loose loops on either side of the main parking area into a figure-8 via the paved connector trail.

Eastern access is very difficult, requiring a long drive over dirt forest service roads that includes a stream ford.  The eastern end of the trail itself is also difficult to find. The best way to find it is to hike north from the access road along the railroad tracks (active route, with both freight and Amtrak traffic) until the tracks bridge a small stream. There should be a wooden kiosk at this point, but downed trees still make the trail difficult to find. It is best found using a GPS receiver.\r\n\nOnce it starts climbing Rough Mountain, the trail is easy to follow and in pretty good shape. It crests the ridge (you can bushwhack from here south to Griffith Knob for great views) and then heads west down to private property.
