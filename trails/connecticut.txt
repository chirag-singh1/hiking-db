After crossing the bridge the trail turns to the right.  The trail here is wide and gravely as it ascends up the east side of the falls, providing similar views as before.  After turning slightly to the right, the trail passes bathrooms and a small, but well-built pavilion to the right and Papermill Pond to the left. It then enters the woods where the first red blazes can be found.\r\n\nAfter entering the woods the trail goes from a footpath to a hiking trail as the terrain becomes rougher and less even. It continues through rocky up and downs until it passes the tower spur to the right. The trail descends more steeply on this side, then it ascendes on the other. This section is by no means technical, but it can be a little more tricky for some. It then crosses a short boardwalk by the river. The rest of the trail hugs the gorge that has been created by the river's flow.

This trail is well blazed throughout.\r\n\nThe Lone Pine Trail begins as it splits off from the Mattabesett Trail on the northern end of the ridge that contains Bluff Head. It continues through some Guilford Conservation Land Trust land until it enters into the James Valley Preserve, a municipal preserve. This area of the trail is a little up and down and alternates between a singletrack trail and a more doubletrack trail that seems to be either a current or past forest road.  \r\n\nWhile on this forest road the trail descends steeply into the valley. There the trail parallels Hemlock Brook. All throughout, this area gives a true sense of wilderness despite being close to civilization. After paralleling the brook, the trail turns to the right and crosses the watercourse. It then turns to the right again and parallels the brook on the other side. \r\n\nThis may seem redundant, but it gives great views of the water as it cascades down the ravine that it has carved (when the brook swells due to rain or snowmelt, it can become something of a waterfall). The trail ascends once again and continues on the ridge of the gorge that the larger part of Hemlock Brook has carved. This is an unexpectedly scenic part of the hike. After descending to the brook the trail crosses a few bridges and double tracks with a forest road.\r\n\nThe trail then passes the North Slope Trail and continues onto an old gravel road that passes a few farms and fields on either side.  After a short stint on the road, the trail returns to the woods just north of Myer Huber Pond.  This area has a few streams and is prone to flooding.  Because of this many small bridges and primitive boardwalks have been installed.  Next, there is a short road walk on Route 77.  \r\n\nThe trail returns to nature in the Braemore Preserve, another municipal preserve. This preserve includes an old field next to the road and a long, but primitive boardwalk that leads into the woods.  The most notable feature of Braemore is the large rock formations that are contained within it.  Once the trail returns to the woods these formations are immediately apparent.  \r\n\nThe trail climbs through these formations before leveling off a bit. It then descends into the Rockland Preserve, yet another municipal preserve.

From its inception until it turns north, the trail bounces around vernal ponds and across multiple small bridges. Keep an eye out, especially in spring, for the CT state flower, the Mountain Laurel. It shouldn't be hard to miss... \r\n\nAt ~1.3 miles, the trail begins to contour trending north as it rises and falls over the reservoir's granite-laden topography. Continue to follow the blue blazes as they eventually lead you to an awesome overlook resplendent with  a bench to picnic at! This is the perfect place for a quick snack. After taking in enough of the view, the trail skirts the reservoir north, offering plentiful views along the way.\r\n\nOnce you've crossed a well-built bridge with hand rails, the trail begins to trend upwards after lulling you into a false sense of ease. You'll soon pop out onto Newtown Turnpike (Rte. 53) after crossing a larger bridge. Cross the road (beware of cars!) and follow the stone steps to a sharp left-hand turn that throws you directly back into the woods.\r\n\nFrom here, the trail begins its most difficult climb, twisting its way to a stunning overlook at the north end of the reservoir. Take in the views and enjoy a well-earned rest, the climb is still not over... From here, the trail follows a serpentine path that will finally bring you to its high-point and an intersection. Unless you're headed to the parking area on Deer Hill Road, follow the blue blazes southwest, eventually reaching an intersection with Universal Access Connector.\r\n\nFrom this intersection, the trail crosses Rte. 53 (watch for cars!) and dives south. Good work, you're over halfway done with the trail!\r\n\nContinue south as Saugatuck Trail undulates steeply both up and down, eventually passing Tudor Road. The parking area found on this spot has a restroom, the first you'll have encountered on this journey.\r\n\nFrom here, the trail continues to closely follow the reservoir's shoreline south. Be careful at each road crossing as there are five more to tackle: Newtown Turnpike (Rte. 53) three times, Valley Forge once, and Godfrey Road.
