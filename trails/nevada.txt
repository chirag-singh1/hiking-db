If you do not have a high clearance, 4x4 vehicle, it may be worth parking lower on the dirt road in one of the many pullouts and hiking up to the trailhead. The trail is a good singletrack with many switchbacks and a decent grade for most of the route. It is a really good run on the downhill, and a good portion of it is pretty runnable on the uphill.\r\n\nThe first mile is a solid climb up to a saddle around 7,300 feet. The views from the saddle are great, and there are some very interesting rock formations on this ridge that you hike right next to.\r\n\nThe trail levels out for a short while before you hit a mile-long section of switchbacks. Over this mile, you gain about 500 feet, so it's a solid climb. The trail then hugs the side of the mountain and curves around a ridgeline, offering excellent and varied views. The grade on this section is not as steep, so it offers a nice reprieve from climbing for a while. It is also on the north side of the ridge, so there are aspen groves that provide more shade.\r\n\nAround mile 3.75, the trail splits, but the trails reunite within 0.1 miles. This is where the trail gets really steep. For the remaining 1.5 miles, you gain nearly 1,000 feet, grinding through some brutal switchbacks.\r\n\nThe trail ends after about 5.3 miles at a junction with the Ruby Crest National Recreation Trail. At the junction you turn left, going uphill, to get to Overland Lake and its accompanying cirque. If you go right, you start heading northbound on the Ruby Crest Trail, through Overland Canyon, which is a lush, riparian area full of flowers, brush, cliffside views, and streams.\r\n\nOverland Lake is another 0.4 miles and 300 feet of climbing. There is another lake above Overland Lake less than 0.5 miles away.\r\n\nIt is important to note that there is no water on this trail until you get to Overland Lake.

While the sign says the trail is unmarked, this isn't the case. Metal post trail markers are spaced several hundred feet apart along the trail, providing the primary means of navigation for the latter half.\r\n\nThe initial two miles of Pinnacles is a somewhat unpleasant hike through a dry creek wash. Creek bed \"trails\" tend to be either very sandy or very rocky, and this section includes both. With little to look at and the difficulty of sinking into uphill sandy terrain, the trail here deters many visitors - but press on, better features lie ahead. On the upside, it's impossible to get lost, as the trail never ventures from the wash.\r\n\nAt the mile and a half point, the trail rounds the large foothills to its right, and the namesake Pinnacles come into view. Keep an eye out for a trail marker with a small arrow pointing right, leading straight through the formations. If you find yourself circling around the Pinnacles to the left, you've missed it.\r\n\nThe brilliantly colored smoothrock formations surrounding the trail are what make this hike worthwhile. There are plenty of opportunities to explore, climb, and look into small natural caves. Due to the terrain, trail markers aren't placed through this segment, but continuing north, there is really only one good way through. Less experienced hikers should turn around at this point.\r\n\nDepending on your route, some light scrambling will lead out of the Pinnacles to the north. The trail is hard to see here, so look for another marker after cresting the hill. Eventually the trail rejoins another dry wash and continues to circle northeast. As the end of the foothills fade off on your right, continue along the wash. It'll feel like you've gone too far, so keep an eye out for a series of three markers leading out. The first points forward along the wash. A few hundred feet later, another points right, exiting the creek bed, and the third confirms your route a few hundred feet beyond that. Make sure you see all three.\r\n\nThe last segment is a mostly straight, marker-to-marker hike through the desert flatlands. Most of the trail here is unidentifiable, so you're using the sign posts for orientation. Navigation here is challenging, so if you get lost, aim towards the parking area straight ahead - it's easy to see. There is no marker where you rejoin the outbound trail, but the GPS track can help.

The trail is marked with an arrowhead on one side and a hiker on the other attached to a post about 4 ft in height. These signs are found throughout the trail, and you can't go more than 0.25 miles without seeing one.  \r\n\nThis trail is not well maintained in certain places, so it is very easy to go off route, miss a sign and think a wash is the trail. Throughout this trail, you'll cross many washes, so be aware of this fact. The trail consists of mostly single and doubletrack. To start, about 1 mile into the trail, you'll pass some cool red rocks just to your left as the trail bends around these formations. At about 1.5 miles into the trail, you'll cross your first of many washes. (Side note, this first wash can be used as an alternate route. It follows adjacent to the actual trail and pretty much stays to the left of the trail, if you're heading west to east, for the next ~4 miles until you re-intercept the Arrowhead Trail with the sign on the left side of the wash up on a small embankment at about the 5-5.5 mile mark. If you follow this wash, you'll notice it spans out nearly 100 ft wide in some places. This wash is very manageable, consisting of mostly compact gravel and hard dirt/clay. I would consider it just as good as the trail itself, and you are less likely to make a wrong turn. This wash does have some tripping hazards like exposed fiber optic cables, so be careful).  \r\n\nIf you stay on trail, I marked this first wash crossing with a rock pile; hopefully, you have success crossing your first wash. You'll notice on this trail, it can be difficult to determine if you are still on trail. If you scan the horizon, you can usually spot your next trail sign off in the distance which will keep you on the path. The Hiking Project mobile app is pretty accurate as well, so if your carrying your phone and see that you drifted from the route then you might want to retrace steps.  \r\n\nAt mile ~5, you'll cross that same giant wash mentioned as alternate route. Once you get across this wash and see the sign on embankment, the terrain changes into a darker rock/clay and its very scenic over the next mile (easy to lose the trail on this section) until you eventually hit the V. of F. highway.

If you begin here, note that you'll have to hike for a bit on the Upper Bristlecone Trail before you even reach the start of this trail. The total elevation gain is approximately 6,000 ft. If you decide to start from the Lower Bristlcone Trailhead, you'll add 4 miles to your hike (about 26 miles out and back to Bonanza Peak).\r\n\nThe first 6 miles or so are mostly uphill. The grades will be steep, but this is the most strenuous portion of the trail. \r\n\nMile 0-2.5: Stay on the Upper Bristlecone Trail until you see the sign for the Bonanza Trailhead.\r\n\nMile 3.5-4: Mt Charleston Wilderness sign. At this fork, the trail veers to the right up some wooden steps.\r\n\nMile 6.5: Trail splits: Bonanza Trail continues on to left and up McFarland Peak to the right. If you find yourself doing some class 2 scrabbling, you have probably bit off on the McFarland Peak Trail.\r\n\nMiles 7-9: Downhill...enjoy it because you'll be climbing the next 2-3 miles on switchbacks to Bonanza Peak.  \r\n\nMile 9: Wood Spring. A metal box, which is now rusted, acts as a seasonal water source. Don't rely on it during the summer months. About 40 yards after it, the trail forks. If you follow the left fork, it will lead across a small gully and into an area with few campsites. The right fork continues onto the trail.\r\n\nMile 10.5: Keep a close eye out for the Bonanza Peak Summit Spur. There is a large kairn constructed where the peak use-trail begins. Kairns mark the way towards the summit, but there are many scrambling routes to reach the summit. At this point you can choose your own adventure. You'll see a green tin can at the peak.\r\n\nMile 10.5 to the end: If your goal isn't Bonanza Peak, you'll stay on the trail as it meanders around the foot of the mountain. The trail here is mostly rolling, though much flatter than the beginning. The trail ends at the Northern Bonanza Peak Trailhead. \r\n\nThis route is a bit more remote than say the Mt Charleston South/North Loop. I didn't run into any fellow hikers on my Sunday outing. When I made this trip in December, about 1/3 of the trail was snow covered (average 3-4 inches of snow).

The trees thin out and the remainder of the loop offers little to no shade, so bring hats, sunscreen, and water. After another quarter mile a sign post marks the beginning of the actual loop and points hikers forward in efforts to hike the loop clockwise.  If you went right at the sign post, you would be hiking the loop backwards/counter clockwise.

The views of nearby mountains and canyons will be pretty spectacular.   If you're lucky, you may see some deer, especially if hiking later in the afternoon/early evening.  About a mile and a half into your hike (the halfway point), you'll see a great view of the Mt.
