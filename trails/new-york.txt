The entire section is marked with orange blazes. During the spring and early summer, the trail can be significantly muddy.\r\n\nStarting from the parking area along Italy Valley Road (42.6239, -77.2815), begin with a 1,000-foot climb up Italy Hill over 3 miles. At mile 4, descend due south on a rocky road that turns into Dunn Road. Turn right (west) on Italy Hill Turnpike, picking up the trail again on the left in less than 0.5 miles. \r\n\nThe trail crosses Emerson Road, Wetmore Road, and Italy Hill Road in quick succession. There may be many blue maple sap lines crossing the trail in this area; just duck under them. When the trail intersects Pulteney Road, turn right and follow the road down the hill about 0.3 miles, re-entering the trail on the right.\r\n\nAt about mile 19, Bud Valley Campground is on the left. This is the site of a major aid station for Twisted Branch 100k every year, so it's very friendly toward hikers. Around mile 20, as you follow blazes east along Faber Road, do not follow orange blazes right where they quickly dead end in a small clearing with a wooden shack. Instead, continue down Faber Road another 0.5 miles until the trail turns right.\r\n\nAt about mile 22, there is one final major climb of about 600 feet. The rest of the trail to the end of the section is a relatively easy cruise.\r\n\nOn this FLT section, there is parking available along Italy Valley Road  (42.6239, -77.2815), Dunn Road (42.6207, -77.2586), the shoulder of Italy Turnpike (42.5993, -77.2629), the shoulder of Italy Hill Road (42.585, -77.2569), the shoulder of Pultney Road (42.5765, -77.2391), Glodes Corners-Browns Corners Road (42.531, -77.2659), the shoulder of Prattsburg-Pultney Road (42.5077, -77.2718), and the shoulder of Elmboise Road (42.4876, -77.2413).", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7030215/patch-road-descent", "ratings": {"rating": 4.5, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 24.7, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [2075, 1010], "alt-change": [3741, 3003], "avg-grade": 5.0, "max-grade": 32.0}},

It is managed by the New York State Park system.\r\n\nThis section begins at Genesee Junction, the site of an old turntable, near the live rail line south of the airport in Rochester, New York.

Pass old locks from the Genesee Valley Canal about mile 3.0.\r\n\nAt mile 5.0, the trail passes under I-90; 2 miles later, the trail crosses Oatka Creek in Canawaugus Park. About mile 9.2, pass the Lehigh Valley Trail and an old rail bridge over the Genesee River. The rail line ran over the Western New York and Pennsylvania Railroad at this point, so you'll pass between the stone pillars that once held up the trestle.

Morris Dam.  The trail starts out paralleling the magnificent lower gorge of the Genessee River with some spectacular views.  The trail travels inland often to cross some tributaries, but after a few miles, it follows very close to one of the steepest and deepest part of the lower gorge, with some short side trails to overlooks.  \r\n\nSoon after these spectacular views, there is an intersection in a pine grove that allows you to bail out to the road paralleling the park.  Staying on the trail, you go right down a long descent.  You now enter the central part of the park where the Genessee Valley is a broad valley rather than gorge.  There are many many tributaries to cross along this stretch.  Some are pleasant with a long slog inward to a good crossing spot and then a downhill along the other side.  Others are much less fun and are classic poor trail design creek crossings which plunge straight into the creek bed, and straight up the other side.  \r\n\nSoon, you climb up to another intersection which is yet another bail out to the road.  But keep continue on because the creek crossings start to diminish and you have many long ups and downs along the tributaries.\r\n\nAfter you pass a log lean to slightly off the trail to your right, you come to another bailout to the road.  Usually you are tired by now, so that is often a good idea.  If not, be prepared for a very long downhill followed by a very long uphill in the next section.  \r\n\nNext you come to the section along Dishmill Creek and it soon it dumps you out on the old tow path that followed the canal that used to bypass the gorge.  This section is a road but then it turns into a grassy towpath - flat and straight.  This gets interupted by a technical part (due to a landslide) as it approaches the upper (most spectacular) gorge.  Upon returning to the old tow path, it passes under the RR bridge, and ends with some singletrack just before ending at the road.  \r\n\nTurn around - it's only 22 miles back!

Because there is a road to the summit of Whiteface Mountain, this trail gets little traffic. It has two very steep sections and a very flat section in between that tends to be full of water or at least very muddy even when it is not raining.\r\n\nAfter about two miles, the trail levels out. Soon after, you'll pass a trail junction (marked by a massive cairn and orange post) with the trail to the summit of Esther Mountain (Esther Mountain Trail). About a quarter mile past this, you'll pass the remnants of an old section of a ski resort lift. This is at almost exactly 4,000 feet in elevation and the trail becomes steep again after this point. \r\n\nJust before the summit ridge, the trail parallels Route 431 but does not cross the road. The summit ridge is long and exposed. Be prepared for the possibility of very high winds.\r\n\nUnfortunately, you'll not be alone on the summit because of the road to the top. You'll have the satisfaction of climbing to the top of a 46'er while all the others drove up. The view is amazing with great views of Lake Placid.", "features": "Fall Colors \u00b7 Views", "condition": "All Clear"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7036131/exposed-summit-ridge", "ratings": {"rating": 4.7, "num_reviewers": 9}, "stats": {"dist": 4.9, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [4853, 1309], "alt-change": [3578, 33], "avg-grade": 14.0, "max-grade": 42.0}},

Begin at the concourse near the Hall of Springs and head south past the Lincoln Baths and into the woods. The trail descends moderately steeply to the Geyser Loop road, crosses the Geyser brook and turns sharply right following the brook on a singletrack path past the natural, gas geyser to a small waterfall beneath the bridge to the Saratoga Performing Arts Center. Here you'll pass a natural tufa outcrop, one of the few on the east coast. \r\n\nFrom the waterfall, ascend the stairs to the top of the cliff and proceed to follow the path under the bridge and past the Orenda Spring. The park has many fresh water and naturally carbonated springs that were considered healthful in the past. Feel free to sample the water, but most of the people who like the water are locals.\r\n\nJust past the spring the trail re-enters the woods and emerges near a picnic pavilion where it crosses the Geyser Loop Road and once again joins a singletrack which rolls through beautiful hardwood forest until it encounters a gravel road which leads to the Peerless Pool complex, which the trail skirts around in the woods.\r\n\nThe trail ascends a slight grade and crosses the East-West Road at the South Route 50 entrance. Crossing the road it follows a power line blaze for a short distance before it becomes a singletrack and passes a small pond with an observation blind for bird watching. You can typically find Canadian Geese, ducks, Great Blue Herons, and many other birds here.\r\n\nThe trail turns sharply left and descends to the power line blaze again where it turns left once more. A short distance and the trail goes back into the woods where it rolls along for a distance until it crosses the East-West Road. Another short distance and you emerge near the parking lot for the Peerless Pool. It then traverses in front of the parking lot on a lawn that doubles as a Frisbee Golf course.\r\n\nThe course arcs around the pool complex and picks up the trail again as it descends steeply to the Geyser Creek where it turns right and follows to a bridge on the East-West Road. Cross the creek here and ascend back into the woods where it rolls easily along eventually running along the crest of the beautiful Ferndell Gorge. The trail encounters the North-South Road where the trail up Ferndell intersects but immediately dodges left back into the woods.

So this trail was designed to be routed almost entirely adjacent to the course of Sprague Brook as it travels through its namesake park.  This allows for adequate drainage by using the slope down towards the brook, or running near the edge of the ravines, which take advantage of the lowered water table, which is lowered by the many seeps along the ravines.  \r\n\nThis routing has its advantages and disadvantages.  In addition to allowing for a drier trail, it also provides some spectacular views into the ravines.  However, the edges tend to have a lot of spruce growth which, following compaction of the trail from use, sports many relentless rooty sections which can be easy to trip on.  Overall, though, the trail has become extremely popular in the first 8 years since it was built.\r\n\nThe trail starts from the XC ski loop, about a third of the way around.  A kiosk marks the start, and the hiker is immediately greeted with some very rooty sections for about the first half mile.  After that, it settles down a bit into a smoother singletrack as it crosses a tributary, only to reenter the spruce as it heads back to the main ravine.  \r\n\nIt follows the ravine except for two more tributaries which it follows up and crosses near the park boundary.  The second of these sports a new massive bench cut on a steep sidehill that replaces a formerly used two-track that was always wet and steep.\r\n\nAfter one more tributary crossing (the aptly named \"ditch\"), the trail makes its descent to cross Sprague Brook just before the park boundary.  This is a get-your-feet-wet crossing.\r\n\nAfter a steep climb up to the opposite side of the ravine, the trail continues back, the time following the brook downstream.  Once again, some spruce sections rear their ugly roots.  This side also has lots more water coming in from the west, so even with the routing near the ravine edge, WNYMBA has had to haul in a lot of stone to keep the trail in good shape.\r\n\nEventually, the trail nears the upper campground.

The trail immediately starts down a tree covered path with a few rocks, roots and some mud. After crossing over a stream via bridge, you climb up a surprisingly steep trail to a series of interconnected meadows. After re-entering the woods, following the purple blazes and TKT placards you turn left through a gap in a stone wall and then descend into a ravine. At the bottom of the ravine, take a moment to get a picture or 3 and then cross the stream using the rocks. On the other side of the stream climb the embankment and stay to the right. You'll climb steadily until you come to Arcady Rd.  \r\n\nCrossing Arcady look left for the purple blazes and the TKT placards. After re-entering the woods and climbing a short set of stone steps you'll come to a wide grassy trail, make sure to turn right. For the next 1.5-2 miles you'll not see any TKT placards only far apart purple blazes. Follow the grass trail up a fairly constant incline until it becomes a narrow path again. You'll know that you are on the right path (besides the purple blazes), once you start seeing NYC DEP signs. Eventually you'll break out into old and unused farm fields. Following the trail you'll eventually come to Aqueduct Street and the road portion of the trail.\r\n\nTurning right onto Aqueduct Street you'll slowly descend towards the Croton Reservoir. At the bottom of Aqueduct St you turn left onto Croton Dam Rd which is gravelly and very poorly maintained. On this road you'll have views of the reservoir and the superstructures of the two bridges that cross the reservoir. Keep an eye out to the left for TK placards are purple blazes for the spot you'll be heading off road again.\r\n\nOnce you find the trail, turn left, take a deep breath and gird yourself for a steep ascent over a trail that seems to be barely used and is full of loose rocks and branches. Following the trail you'll climb out of NYC DEP land and into John Hand County Park. While the TKT is well marked there are several other trails inside the park that are not marked at all. Eventually, you'll begin to descend into an extremely small parking area. Here you'll turn right onto Blinn Rd and continue approximately 1000 feet and then cross the road into the Teatown portion of the trail.

It is a work-in-progress, connecting Rochester to Black Creek, with plans to extend the trail to Cuba and possibly Hinsdale.\r\n\nBegin at the parking area in downtown Mount Morris. The Genesee Valley Greenway also heads north from here up to Rochester.\r\n\nTravel south on the trail down to Sonyea about mile 3.8. Cross over the Genesee River, then take a right onto Craig Drive. Turn right at the T and follow the old road as it enters the forest; turn right when the road forks. You're currently in Sonyea State Forest - the creek washed out the railbed, so this is a work-around.\r\n\nAbout mile 6, the trail/road forks; turn left.  After about another mile, the road becomes a more \"real\" road; keep heading south to Presbyterian Road.  Turn right. At the T with Main Street (30A), turn left and continue south. Turn right on Barron Road, then left for a short distance on Creek Road. Turn left again on Dudley Road. About mile 14, you can turn right back onto the Genesee Valley Greenway Trail.  (You can also turn left, but only for a short distance).\r\n\nYou get to be on the trail for only a mile, then turn left on the road to Cooperville Road.  Turn right to pick up the trail (on left) about a mile after you left it.\r\n\nAt mile 19.1, you'll cross Oakland Road and need to go slightly right (uphill) to pick up the trail.  (Going left (downhill) you can see the Oakland Locks, part of the Genesee Valley Canal. A trail goes beside the locks to connect with the Greenway , but the Greenway is an easier ride).\r\n\nAbout mile 22.5, cross the dirt road in Letchworth State Park.  Signs warn that the trail ends a short distance ahead - that's ok.\r\n\nEnjoy the next section of trail - you've been following the Genesee Valley Canal for a while, but now you're sandwiched with the canal on the left and Letchworth Gorge on the right. Occasional peek-a-boo views through the trees let you know not to get close to the edge!\r\n\nLess than a mile after the road, the trail ends at a pile of dirt and signs warning of a landslide area ahead. The landslide tumbled the old rail bed and canal into Letchworth Gorge, so if you want to pick it up, you'll have to go back out to the road and take Rt-436 right into Portageville. From the end of the trail, enjoy views of Deh-ga-ya-soh Falls; you can also see Middle Falls, but be warry of possible cave-ins on the cliff edge.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 Historical Significance \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Waterfall \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "All Clear"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7073448/deh-ga-ya-soh-falls-from-the-genesee-valley-greenway", "ratings": {"rating": 4.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 23.4, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [1173, 599], "alt-change": [1163, 697], "avg-grade": 2.0, "max-grade": 11.0}},

At 2.75 miles, the trail gets even steeper with some occasional small rock scrambling and plenty of mud. \r\n\nBy 3.0 miles you're rewarded with a view of the mountains around you. There is a small clearing on a rock face that provides a nice view and a good place to take a break. Many think this is the summit, but you're not quite there. If you came for a view, you might as well head back now. If you want to claim that you climbed the mountain, you must continue.\r\n\nFor the final 0.6 miles, hikers follow the ridge at the top of the mountain, where you can see the sky between the trees when you look both left and right. A very gentle rolling trail will eventually lead you to a rock in the middle of the woods. You'll see a round marker that says \"Scarface Mtn\" on it. You have reached the summit!

You'll also have a few rock scrambles and some amazing views of rock ledges hanging over the trail. \r\n\nJust shy of the summit, the trail becomes open rock and is marked by yellow paint on the rocks. Be sure to follow the markers to avoid erosion. The hike is not long from here, and you'll soon reach the summit clad with three survey markers on it. The summit views are amazing in all four seasons. The wind can be very strong, so be prepared with extra layers.\r\n\nYou may also follow the yellow-blazed trail beyond the summit to find a plaque dedicated to the Hermit of Ampersand.", "features": "Cave \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Views", "condition": "All Clear"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7063934/top-of-ampersand-mountain-viewing-one-of-the-saranac-lakes", "ratings": {"rating": 4.8, "num_reviewers": 8}, "stats": {"dist": 2.7, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [3336, 1579], "alt-change": [1793, 36], "avg-grade": 13.0, "max-grade": 70.0}},

The herd path is marked by a cairn on the right side of the Ward Brook Truck Trail 0.1 miles past Ward Brook Lean-To.\r\n\nThe bottom part of the trail is a moderate incline that tends to be muddy. The top part is wet even in August and features many difficult rock faces that need to be climbed. As hard as it is to get up, getting down safely is much trickier.\r\n\nThe trail starts to open up with limited views to the north as you continue to climb, so you can tell when you are getting closer to the top even without an altimeter. Just below the summit is a tiered ledge just off the path to the right (west) with a fantastic view of the Seward Range and the Ampersand Range. The true summit (complete with sign) is 0.1 miles farther on. There is another beaten trail from the summit to a restricted view of the Santanoni Range and some of the Eastern High Peaks Zone.\r\n\nThere are no other spur trails that diverge from this herd path, so you need to retrace your steps (carefully) to come down.", "features": "Fall Colors \u00b7 Views", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7072291/seward-range-from-just-below-the-summit-of-seymour", "ratings": {"rating": 5.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 1.5, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [4119, 2173], "alt-change": [1946, 0], "avg-grade": 25.0, "max-grade": 63.0}},

There are several locations to cross. This is due to people looking for the best place to cross, which depends on water levels. If crossing at the first point you can access the stream, turn right once across and follow the faint trail until the trail turns left and travels uphill.\r\n\nAnother 0.5 miles from the stream crossing there is another stream crossing, but this one is easy and not very wide. After this point, the trail climbs steadily along a rocky and root-covered trail. At about mile 3, you come to a trail junction with Nye Mountain Trail. This is actually carved into a tree.\r\n\nTurn left to the summit of Street Mountain. This is the most enjoyable section because the trail travels through rocks and trees covered in many shades of green moss. There is no view from the actual summit\u2014only a sign.

At the trailhead, there is a moderate parking area that has room for between 10-20 cars. \r\n\nAs you start out on your journey, the going will be fairly easy. In this first section, the trail follows an old road trace so there is often room to hike two abreast. The trail is still rocky, so do watch your ankles! You'll pass through a mixed forest of birch, beech, and other Adirondack natives that will shade your way. Especially in the summer months, the shade is much appreciated. \r\n\nYou'll cross over both Nellie and Guideboard Brook. It's worth noting that stopping to fill up water at Guideboard Brook is recommended. There are bridges over both bodies of water, and you won't have to worry about getting your boots wet... Yet. \r\n\nAs you continue on, the track will narrow. You'll have to work your way up and over a ridge, and while not overly steep, this initial climb makes a noticeable change from the flat hiking that you've been enjoying. After reaching a brief peak, you'll enjoy a brief descent into the most notable part of this trail. At the bottom of the slope, you'll need to make your way through the infamous Marcy Swamp. \r\n\nWhile the segment leading through Marcy Swamp is short, it is time-consuming, and aside from the novelty of negotiating a swamp, mostly Type 2 fun. There are blazes and many log bridges spanning the wettest sections, but you'll likely still leave with muddy boots. The vegetation is mostly lower growing here, and the sun can be fierce in the summer months. Combined with the humidity of this section, you'll be happy to see the other side. \r\n\nOnce you reach the other side of the swamp, you'll begin a slow and steady ascent towards Panther Gorge and Mount Marcy. The vegetation transitions sharply, and the willows of the swamp will transition to a mixed forest of both deciduous and evergreen trees. Though you'll be making your way up, the path is quite pleasant as most of the tread is softened by needle-fall. As you continue to gain elevation, the deciduous trees will thin, and the forest will become predominantly evergreen. \r\n\nAbout 2.5 miles from the swamp, the trail will begin a steep uptick, and you'll really notice the elevation gain. This is the final push towards Panther Gorge. Commonly regarded as one of the most beautiful locations in the High Peaks (though those partial to Avalanche Lake may disagree) Panther Gorge makes for an excellent place to stop. With a thundering fall located near the trail and sweeping views to the south and west, the effort will be well worthwhile.

Formerly separated by Little Hell Gate channel, the two islands were filled in by the early 1960s and now host over 400 acres of parkland in addition to city infrastructure.\r\n\nBeginning from the 103rd Street Footbridge (1951), head south on Wards Island along the Harlem River, viewing Manhattan's upper East Side to your right. At the bottom of the island, the trail passes under the RFK Bridge (formerly Triborough; 1936) and Hell Gate Bridge (1917). Between the two bridges, a native plant garden is located to your right. Across the street, on top the hill to your left, is the island's urban farm. The trail continues underneath Hell Gate bridge where paving ends. \r\n\nTo exit the under-bridge path you'll pass through a gate. The trail starts/stops here due to the existence of the Wards Island Water Pollution Control Plant (1937), which serves over 1 million city residents with a capacity of 275 million US gallons per day (in addition to a telltale aroma). Continue following the direction of the bridge until the street turns toward the left; here you'll make a right to return underneath Hell Gate Bridge where a stretch of paved path resumes. While you traverse this section, you are crossing the original boundary between Wards and Randalls Islands.\r\n\nAt the end of this path, follow the mulched trail on your left. You'll return back to the street, passing a bus stop. Again, continue via a stretch of sidewalk in the direction of Hell Gate Bridge. You'll cross entrance roads leading to the water treatment plant and the NYC Fire Department's training academy on your right. After crossing, you'll see that the paved trail resumes beneath Hell Gate Bridge.\r\n\nFollow the trail a short distance until you see a paved footpath exiting to your right. From here, you'll circle counterclockwise along the Sunken Meadow Loop, passing by the Tennis Academy on your right and numerous baseball diamonds to your left (this corner of Randalls Island hosts 31 diamonds). Past the Tennis Academy you'll see one baseball diamond to your right; here, veer to the right to head up a small hill. This area hosts native grasses and has a small pull off at the top. In addition to a view of the East River, at this location you can turn around to see some of the Fire Academy's buildings; a sharp eye will spot burn marks trailing out from some of the windows.The academy features a subway tunnel with tracks and two subway cars, a helicopter pad, a replica ship, and multiple buildings designed to simulate the different types of structures encountered within the city limits (most of this is out of sight).\r\n\nContinuing to circle along the outermost path, you'll begin to head west along the Bronx Kill. This shallow straight delineates the border between Manhattan and the Bronx. After crossing under Hell Gate bridge, you'll reach the RFK/Triborough; cross underneath and continue along the sidewalk/trail.\r\n\nAs you follow the sidewalk while looping around the top of Randalls Island, you'll be passing more baseball diamonds to your right. Just before crossing under the overpass, on your right is the NYPD Harbor Unit marina. Keep to your right to follow the Harlem River Path.\r\n\nContinuing south, Icahn Stadium (2005) is on your left. South of the stadium you'll encounter a roundabout area where you'll turn right to pass across Little Hell Gate bridge through a salt marsh, crossing the original boundary between the two islands. \r\n\nTurning right after exiting the marsh, you'll pass through a wooded area and the Water's Edge Garden, featuring native plants and a view of East Harlem across the river. You'll pass a small horse stable on your left before completing the loop.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Views", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7030373/view-across-harlem-river-towards-e-117th-st-from-end-of-waters-edge-garden-path", "ratings": {"rating": 4.0, "num_reviewers": 4}, "stats": {"dist": 4.9, "dist-type": "Loop", "alt-range": [29, 4], "alt-change": [68, 70], "avg-grade": 1.0, "max-grade": 2.0}},

If you fancy a workout, climb the interior stairs to the top of the monument for sweeping views of the area.  \r\n\nOnce you get back down and collect your breath, look for a sign toward the cemetery that describes Victory Woods and what happened there. Follow the white dots on the ground through the cemetery, which was founded in the mid-1800s. The trail meanders through the cemetery along a private drive before heading downhill to the left. The trail moves onto a boardwalk near the end of Monument Drive, which provides an alternative parking location if you don't want to hike through the cemetery.  \r\n\nAs the trail moves through the woods, signs provide information about the experiences of the Colonial and British troops as they fought through this area. The boardwalk comes to a split where you can either go to the left or the right.  If you go to the left, the boardwalk leads to a dead end where there is a picnic table for you to relax. If you go to the right, more signs provide insight into the situation that people faced during the war. The trail is shaded throughout, so it can be enjoyed any time of the day.  \r\n\nFinally, arriving at a sign that marks the end of the trail at the edge of private property, your only real choice is to turn around and head back to your car.

Once on Upper Cherrytown, go 3.1 miles until you see the state trailhead sign on the right. Park and hike across the road to get on the trail. \r\n\nThe trail is marked with blue blazes, snowmobile markers, and the occasional aqua blazes of the Long Path. Hike 1.8 miles on this trail until you are at the bridge at the base of the falls. The falls are more of a set of rapids and cataracts than one continuous drop of water. \r\n\nHike upstream on either side to take in all the beauty of the various \"steps\" to the falls.

Downed trees and overgrowth are common, with the trail seemingly disappearing at times. Do not rely on this GPS track alone when traversing this path - a hard copy map of the local terrain, a keen awareness of your surroundings, and experience with unmarked trails is highly advised. Do not feel afraid to turn back if you lose the trail - better safe than lost!\r\n\nThe trailhead is unmarked on the side of Route 73, and is accessible from just south of the bridge over North Fork Boquet river where a short dirt road leads to a trail registry box (\"North Fork of Boquet\"). Gravel parking space available off the side of the northbound lane of 73, both north and south of the bridge. \r\n\nA small network of herd trails are present at the trailhead (which can be confusing to navigate), with access to both sides of the stream. During the latter half of the trail, multiple stream crossings are required, and the trail is often hard to find without paying close attention to rock cairns and maintaining a keen awareness of your surroundings. The last mile climbs steeply, and will require extra attention to stay on-path. \r\n\nThere are 3 primitive campsites posted with yellow 'tent' markers nailed to trees, at approx miles 1.5, 2.5, and 4. As with all eastern high peaks wilderness camping, no fires are allowed.\r\n\nSee this link for additional discussion:  adkhighpeaks.com/forums/for\u2026", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 Lake \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7080306/one-of-three-posted-camp-sites-on-the-boquet-forks-trail-to-grace-peak", "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 5.7, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [3796, 1340], "alt-change": [2642, 185], "avg-grade": 9.0, "max-grade": 51.0}},

Well-marked and easy to follow, the route begins with a gradual climb. Soon, the trail levels off until you come to the Lake Eaton trail junction at 1.2 miles.\r\n\nTurning left at the junction, continue to climb gradually until you are about one mile from the summit. At this point, the trail will become steeper and rocky as you make your way to the false summit. After passing over the false summit the trail drops slightly into a col where you'll see the remains of the old observer's cabin. From here you'll make your final steep push toward the summit.\r\n\nAt the top, the firetower is open to climb.
