Similar to Plum Creek, you'll start by hugging the contour lines on an overgrown logging road that has some very awesome views into the draw below. This is a prime area to spot wildlife since many of the hawks and eagles in the area are frequently hunting this section. This is also the point in the Herron trail system where it makes sense to carry bear spray since this route is isolated and fewer humans are around to scare the furry friends away. \r\n\nIn two miles you'll see the trail shrink down to singletrack and an unmarked trail heading directly uphill on the right.  Go right up the steep trail. After the steep section take a left at the dirt road about 100ft to the Southwest until you see the singletrack pick back up on your left. \r\n\nThis section is more of a rough and rocky romp featuring two short but steep and loose climbs. Hike through this section until the trail intersects with another dirt logging road. Head left on the logging road until it terminates and you can see the singletrack start up again on your right side and head South. This section becomes a steep, narrow path until you hit a three way intersection and stay right towards Blacktail.  \r\n\nThis trail passes through a big 6-way logging road intersection, take the Southernmost and the singletrack picks up again on your left, marked with a pink flag, and heads directly uphill. In 300m you'll hit some logging road, stay left and hike it another 300m to the singletrack on your right. From here, the trail sticks with some great singletrack for a while.  \r\n\nIn about two miles you'll pop out at a dirt road, cross this and hike past the green gate onto the logging road across from the trail. Hike this for a while, over 3 miles, it's not singletrack but it's a fun and pretty section to hike. Just over 3 miles the trail makes a sharp bend around a draw. Don't follow this, the singletrack continues directly up the draw on your left. It remains singletrack from here.

While most trails at Kelly Island are just game trails, the loop described here is a favorite among locals and dog walkers. Please note that this trail is unmaintained and often has logs and other obstacles to navigate around. To access this trail, park at the main fishing access site lot and head north. You'll see some large rocks that create a path across a slough. If the water levels are high, or you do not want to cross the boulders, you can also access this trail from the Humble street access. Once across the rocks, you can head onto the riverbank area or follow the trail that lies at the edge of the forest. This trail does not vary much in elevation, however there are plenty of downed trees that will create obstacles at times. Due to the proximity to the river, the trail conditions can vary widely throughout the year. It is not uncommon for spring water levels to rise above parts of the trail. The short loop goes around the river's edge and into the cottonwood forest that covers much of Kelly Island. Those hiking in the morning or evening have a good chance of seeing birds, and other wildlife like deer and beavers. You can choose to complete the main loop, or go adventure on any of the small trails that weave through the cottonwoods in this area. It is a good thing to note that this area is used for many different activities such as fishing and hunting so please be respectful of all users. While this area does not have too many developed trails, it still offers a great chance to get away from the noise of the city and enjoy a peaceful cottonwood forest along the Clark Fork River.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 Fishing \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Swimming \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7080504/logs-over-the-trail-are-common-some-are-more-difficult-to-navigate-than-others", "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 1.0, "dist-type": "Loop", "alt-range": [3119, 3106], "alt-change": [23, 21], "avg-grade": 1.0, "max-grade": 4.0}},

The trail begins in a small parking lot just past the Grizzly Campground, but the bridge over the creek is washed out; secondary access is through the campground. \r\n\nThe trail starts out all well and good for a mile or two as you hike past an old homestead, then shortly after it crosses the creek on the log bridge things get rougher. The trail passes through the base of several talus fields.\r\n\nAfter 5 miles, you'll reach a junction with the Flat Gulch Trail (some maps label it Chico Gulch). This is roughly the halfway point and the end of the easier part of the trail. Once you pass the Flat Gulch trail, the Ranch Creek Trail becomes a backcountry adventure; the trail enters an old burn area with tall grass often obscuring the trail, there are continued rough sections, and even some minor route finding once you begin to climb up to the Hog Back Ridge. The open burn area is beautiful and offers some great views of the surrounding hills and peaks; there is an obvious outfitter camp on the west side of the valley. The trail looks like it heads over a dilapidated bridge but keep heading south to stay on course. \r\n\nAt roughly 7 miles in, the trail disappears in thick brush and a spring so you may need to do a quick jaunt on the talus field just to the east. Once on the talus, you'll see a well-constructed bridge over the creek. Cross two bridges and begin to ascend up some switchbacks. Keep an eye out for the trail as you get higher on the ridge as it comes and goes for a little over a mile until it reappears for a nice bit of hiking to the Hog Back Ridge Trail.\r\n\nHike the Ranch Creek Trail as an out and back or if you are feeling strong and adventurous, link up with some of the other trails in the area or make a bid for Quigg Peak.

It climbs nearly 1900 feet to Republic Pass (9979 feet) on Yellowstone\u2019s eastern boundary. From there you can continue into the park on the poorly maintained Cache Creek Trail.\r\n\nThe trail lies in the North Absaroka Wilderness Area of Shoshone National Forest. Just a few yards south of the trailhead you cross the wilderness boundary. This is also the boundary between Montana and Wyoming and the 45th parallel of latitude, halfway between the North Pole and the Equator. The trail parallels Republic Creek to its source. The creek cuts a beautiful, mostly-forested valley between Republic Mountain (to the right) and Woody Ridge (on the left). \r\n\nIn 1870 gold was discovered in these parts by a rugged group of prospectors including Adam \u201cHorne\u201d Miller and A.B. Henderson. At that time, this land was part of the Crow Indian Reservation, but that did not stop mining development. In 1882 reservation boundaries were redrawn and the mining camps became a town. One of the earliest and most important mines was the Republic Mine. The high elevation, lack of roads, rugged terrain, and short summer season hampered development. In an unsuccessful effort to convince the Northern Pacific Railroad to lay tracks to the town it was named Cooke City, in honor of railroad executive Jay Cooke Jr.     \r\n\nThe trail travels along the west side of Republic Creek, gradually climbing up the valley. An occasional break in the trees affords nice views south up the valley to the ridgeline. The distinctive knobby top of Republic Peak and Republic Pass (to its right) can be picked out. At the 2.6-mile mark the trail crosses the creek and begins climbing more steeply. From there it climbs 1450 feet in the last 1.7 miles to the pass. As you near the pass the trail gets steeper and steeper and the views get better and better. \r\n\nAt the pass the views are spectacular. You are high in the rugged Absaroka Mountains (pronounced \"AB-sa-RO-ka\" or \"ab-SAR-o-ka\"), which comprise the eastern boundary of Yellowstone. Absaroka, which means \u201cchildren of the large beaked bird\u201d is the Crow Indians\u2019 name for themselves. To the north, above the Republic Creek are the snowy Beartooths. Peering into Yellowstone, the impressive two-toped mountain to the northwest is Amphitheater Mountain. The valley to the south is drained by a tributary of Cache Creek.\r\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

The road should be passable for any vehicle and there is parking space for about 10 cars. There should be some moments for solitude for you on this trail despite it's proximity to Yellowstone: we only encountered two park rangers who were clearing the trail. \r\n\nThe trail drops to and crosses Beaver Creek which it crosses on a bridge before entering the wilderness area. The trail then gradually climbs along open slopes covered in wildflowers in the early summer. You'll be able to see the west fork of Beaver Creek far below you and the mountains that surround the lakes you're heading to in the distance. \r\nYou'll encounter a few narrow sections on crappy, crumbly rock in avalanche/drainage areas. Mind your footing on these sections. There are five in total, only two of which are the most \"tricky\". After these you'll come to a larger drainage that can have a substantial amount of fast-flowing water in the early summer/spring. This crossing had a single sturdy but slippery log in 2019 that was difficult to cross without walking sticks. \r\n\nAfter this you'll enter more wooded areas and get closer to West Fork Beaver Creak. Enjoy some of the cascades (one of which may deserve a name) and rapids as you go. The next significant feature you'll encounter is crossing one of the streams that joins West Fork Beaver Creak (the drainage from Avalanche Lake accessible soon from the Avalanche Lake Trail #152). There are large logs which made crossing this \"easy\". \r\n\nNext you'll switchback up to an intersection with Avalanche Lake Trail #152 and cross yet another creek (easy log present if water is too high to just jump over). From here the trail heads south and gradually gains more elevation. You'll soon be at Triple Lakes! Enjoy the beautiful lakes and views from the trail (which officially ends at Blue Danube Lake) before tracing your steps back.\r\n\nOverall this is a fairly easy trail considering its elevation gain and length, but with a few tricky spots not all hikers will be comfortable with.", "features": "Lake \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7061967/erosion-and-low-quality-rock-define-a-few-gullies-along-the-trail", "ratings": {"rating": 5.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 5.7, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [9050, 6864], "alt-change": [2237, 98], "avg-grade": 8.0, "max-grade": 26.0}},

There should be plenty of parking for this infrequently used trail. \r\n\nStart hiking south along singletrack shared with horses. The first two miles are nearly all in meadows dotted with sage bushes and tons of flowers. This section is easy going as it only gradually gains elevation. You'll enjoy excellent views of the mountains ahead, and occasional views to Hebgen Lake. At about 2.25 miles you'll see the trail leading to the horse forge over Watkins Creek (it seems like most horse traffic takes this route, but crossing by foot could require route finding or getting your feet yet in early summer). \r\n\nAfter the fork with Coffin Lakes Trail #209 the trail will cross the creek and ascend up to a mountain pass.

While the road up can be a bit rough at times, it is still doable in most vehicles. This hike begins in a small gap between the wooden fences along the road. To begin, walk through the gap and turn left to get on the trail. For a short distance, this hike follows the Blue Mountain trail. After following the trail up for a few hundred yards you'll come across Lyon Gulch road and take a right. From here, follow the old road around the north side of the mountain as it gradually gains elevation. This area showcases a different side of the Blue Mountain Recreation Area than most are used to. Because of a fire in the early 2000's, this area is far more open than other trails in the recreation area. Due to this, the trail can be quite warm on summer days so get out early if you plan to hike when it is hot. As you proceed around the gulch, the views will get better and better as you gain elevation. In the spring and summer, wildflowers cover this area and create a beautiful mosaic of colors on the open hillsides. In the fall, young shrubs and larch trees decorate the mountain with beautiful red and yellow colors. Unfortunately, this hike is not accessible during the winter months as Blue Mountain road is gated near the bottom. At the top of the gulch you can enjoy great views of the Missoula and O'brien creek valleys. If it is a clear enough day, you can even see the Mission Mountains in the distance.

It doesn't spend time very close to Logging Creek, but as the trail climbs a hillside, you get views looking down onto the creek and out to a more recent burn with stands of silver trees.\r\n\nFrom here, the trail traverses a hillside, gaining some of the scant elevation found on the trail. It continues along the sparse trees, then older stands of trees, bouncing back and forth a few times and coming close to Logging Creek, before diving into the older stand of trees for the rest of the trip.\r\n\nThe trail parallels the lake for a bit before you actually get to see it. A spur trail for the Logging Lake patrol cabin is your first opportunity to see the lake. It's a long, beautiful lake tucked beneath a wooded ridge. There isn't much of a shore to speak of as the trees and vegetation come right up to the waters edge. A second opportunity to see the lake is at the Logging Lake Foot Campground if you take that spur trail. \r\n\nFrom there, the trail continues away from the lake, eventually following along its shores, then alternating from along the shoreline to up in the trees until it hits the Adair Campground. From there, it heads into the trees until just before the patrol cabin at the head of the lake, then wraps towards the head of the lake, before climbing up through the trees gaining some elevation as it heads towards Grace Lake.\r\n\nThe forest changes a bit as it hugs the mountainside and gains a couple hundred feet of elevation. Moss hangs from the trees of the wetter forest. The trail traverses the hillside and drops slightly as it comes to the shores of the lovely Grace Lake which is tucked below the steep slopes of Mt. Geduhn. Views to the head of the lake are obscured, but the small lake is beautiful and remote.\r\n\nThe trail is incredibly muddy in the spring and buggy into early summer.

The river moves slower here which helps.\r\n\nFrom there, it is more hiking through a wonderful forest until you get to another crossing, this time of Valentine Creek. After an easy ford, keep your creek crossing shoes on as another one that doesn't always make it on the map shows up about 50 yards down the trail. \r\n\nOnce across the second Valentine Creek ford, the trail reaches the base of the mountain and begins its climb. The trail has many switchbacks, but they help maintain a wonderful grade up the entire mountain.\r\n\nAs you get higher, the trees gradually give way to low growing alpine plants and subalpine fir. With each step, more mountains become visible and your view up the Valentine Creek drainage gets better. \r\n\nOnce at the lookout at the end of the trail, you peer thousands of feet down to the collections of water that form Kootenai Lakes and moose are visible as little dots with trailing mud in the water. These lakes and the snaking Waterton River are backdropped by a fence line of trees with Mount Cleveland, Glacier's ceiling, dominating your view. \r\n\nChances of you seeing anyone on this trail are very slim as few visit the lookout due to its backcountry-only accessibility.\r\n\nThis content was created by Jake Bramante of Hike 734.

In the early season, the bugs can be terrible, but later in the year, the hike is a great, level stroll through the trees. Occasional small ponds and pocket meadows break up the inevitable monotony of the trail. Side trails along the way include one to Kootenai Lakes, the trail up to Porcupine Lookout, and the trail up Pass Creek. The trail up Pass Creek takes you to Stoney Indian Pass.\r\n\nAfter continuing along the level trail for approximately six miles, it switches back and begins to climb. At the switchback, a faint trail continues, but is poorly maintained leading to Kootenai Cabin. From the switchback, the trail begins to work its way up. The trees begin to break up and the trail begins to cross avalanche chutes rewarding you with expansive views of the incredible peaks and valleys in the area.\r\n\nAs it gets closer to the alpine meadows above, the trees get a little thicker, and the vegetation changes to more beargrass and subalpine fir. Glacial erratics, or huge boulders left from large sheets of ice moving them around, dot the landscape. Eventually you pop out into the epic meadows below Cathedral Peak and Mt.

It begins initially steep as this newer route is a cutoff trail to the old trail that came from the Many Glacier Hotel. Once you get up to the trail junction, the grade is steady all the way up to the tunnel.\r\n\nThe trail spends the first few miles traversing a wonderful hillside meadow. Views are jaw dropping in all directions. Moose frequent the valley below while bighorn sheep and mountain goats are frequently seen above. Bears may be seen anywhere in this area.\r\n\nAs you head up the trail, you begin to get into the forest, limiting views. The trail crosses Ptarmigan Creek at a great little waterfall. Shortly thereafter, the Iceberg Lake Trail breaks off to the east. The Ptarmigan Trail works its way up through a forest carpeted with huckleberry plants and gradually breaks out of the trees. The rock walls on either side escort you up the valley towards the headwall of the valley. Just before you begin the switchbacks up to the tunnel, you pass along Ptarmigan Lake.\r\n\nYou wrap around Ptarmigan Lake along its west shore, then leave the vegetation and work your way up the rocky slopes. Two big switchbacks take you up to the amazing tunnel with epic views getting better with every step.\r\n\nThe tunnel is 250 feet long and is wide and tall enough for horses. The other side of the tunnel opens up to steep red rock cliffs and an amazing view of the Belly River drainage with Elizabeth Lake down at the bottom of the valley. The trail here is hewn from the rocky cliffs and is breathtaking as you descend into the valley. Each step reveals the amazing ridgeline to the northwest including Old Sun Glacier on the Mt. Merritt.\r\n\nThe trail descends through the cliffs turning into a trail along red rock slopes. You get into vegetation which gradually turns into trees. A look up the drainage reveals Ahern Glacier, many more summits and Helen Lake. From here, the trail enters the trees, meets up with the Red Gap Pass Trail, then descends to the foot of Elizabeth Lake where it crosses a footbridge and goes to the campground.\r\n\nThe level trail follows the Belly River downstream through trees. It leaves the river for a short stint, then comes back alongside at the top of the fantastic Dawn Mist Falls. It continues down, wraps around Cosley Ridge, then fords the outlet of Cosley Lake.\r\n\nThis content was created by Jake Bramante of Hike 734.

Views are frequent and wonderful up onto the ridgeline and some out to Lake Sherburne. As you approach the top of the ridge, the trail levels off as you pass a surprise lake called Swiftcurrent Ridge Lake. The trail follows the shoreline for a short stint, then continues through a small pass, then begins to descend along the north ridge down to Poia Lake.\r\n\nThe trail descends the ridge fairly rapidly to Kennedy Creek, which playfully bubbles out of the valley. You follow this creek through large, limestone boulder fields that are perfect pika habitat. The views of the surrounding mountains are fantastic.\r\n\nThe trail goes through some trees again and to the campground, then emerges through some willows at the outlet of the lake. The lake is a fantastic place to take a swim with a nice pebbled beach and warm waters in summer. Continue on to a cool footbridge over the outlet of the lake which is a nice place to sit and enjoy the views up the drainage towards Red Gap Pass as well as the whitewater of Kennedy Creek as it excitedly exits down the valley.\r\n\nThe trail continues right along the edge of the lake giving hikers more great views. At the head of the lake, you pass wetlands that turn to grass as you work your way up the valley. The trail is fairly level while you follow the creek further up and the grassy meadows turn more and more into trees.\r\n\nThe trail then turns up onto the hillside and begins to climb in earnest. You'll be climbing for quite a while before reaching the first switchback, but then the trail switchbacks like crazy. The trees begin to get less and less dense as it gives way to sprawling alpine meadows. As you get closer to the pass, the meadows give way to the namesake red rock.\r\n\nAs you crest the pass, the views are incredible with jagged peaks and glaciers visible in all directions. The trail descends through similar red rock and across a cool basin, then drops quickly down into the Belly River drainage through trees as it joins with the Ptarmigan Trail.\r\n\nThis content was created by Jake Bramante of Hike 734.

The trail traverses a short distance through flower filled meadows and small stands of subalpine fir before beginning its climb. The first section of the climb is through a stand of silver trees standing like eery sentinels. The trail then bounces between them and a stand of trees that didn't burn before entering the rocky landscape which you'll travel the rest of the way to the top.\r\n\nViews looking down onto Granite Park Chalet are great and the views of the drainages and summits surrounding the area only get better with each step.

The level trail begins in a pleasant lodgepole forest, then crosses Wilbur Creek. It bounces between open areas and a mixed forest of aspen and lodgepole pines. This drainage is perfect habitat for moose, and the first lake that you pass is a popular one for them. There is a small trail that breaks away to Fishercap Lake approximately a quarter of a mile in. Take that and look for these large members of the deer family in the water.\r\n\nFrom there, it's more level tree filled hiking until you break out into meadows. All around you are the wonderful rocky walls of the surrounding summits. At the head of the valley, Swiftcurrent Mountain sits with the lookout barely visible on top. The trail continues on a fairly level path, passes into some more trees and nears some red cliffs that are popular with mountain goats. It passes by the cliffs and emerges into more open meadows and views, wandering down to the shoreline of Redrock Lake. Keep an eye out for moose in this lake as it wraps around to Redrock Falls. \r\n\nFrom the falls, the trail gently climbs through a mix of trees and meadows along Bullhead Lake with some nice views of the lake. Continue past the lake to the head of the drainage. At this point and a little over four level miles, the trail changes from moose country to bighorn sheep country and begins to climb. This area is covered in huckleberry plants giving you a perfectly valid reason to stop and catch your breath and forage for a snack.\r\n\nAs you gain elevation, you pass waterfalls along a rocky cliff and get amazing views of the valley you traveled up. The trail eventually levels off after many switchbacks and heads up toward the pass in earnest. You pass meadows and subalpine fir until you reach the pass itself marked with a stack of rocks that used to be topped by an old bell before World War II. \r\n\nThe trail continues on down the west side, past the trail to Swiftcurrent Lookout, passing streams that lead to creeks, then rivers below.

The chalet has since been torn down and the road is now a shell of its former self.\r\n\nFinding the trail off of the Red Eagle Trail is tricky and a GPS is recommended. After the Red Eagle Trail passes the junction with the Beaver Pond Trail, it continues southwest, then straight south through an amazing meadow. The trail begins to turn to the southwest again as it drops in elevation. Instead of turning southwest, follow the edge of the trees as if the trail went straight. After some bushwhacking, you'll realize that you're on an old road.\r\n\nThe trail is not really maintained and it's in an old burn area, so expect epic quantities of downfall. The good news is that, once you're on the road, it's easy to stay on, it's a steady grade, and the birding and flowers are epic. The other good news is that you'll have the place all to yourself. \r\n\nThe trail gradually works its way up the ridge with filtered views through gray sticks of burned trees. Pocket pools are occasionally encountered off the trail and prove a nice place for birds. Eventually you reach the top of the ridge giving you views of the lovely divide creek coming out from in between Divide Mountain and Curly Bear Mountain.\r\n\nThe banks have been eroded, so getting down to the water is a tricky, but doable affair.

The history here is great, but mostly hidden as you take an old road through meadows and trees to the shore of St. Mary Lake. This location is the site of the old St. Mary Chalet and boat dock where park visitors would set out on boats to Going-to-the-Sun Point Chalets (what is now Sun Point) before the Going-to-the-Sun Road was constructed.\r\n\nFrom here, the trail veers away from the lake and into the forest. Wonderful pocket meadows interrupt the trees with eruptions of wildflowers in the spring and early summer. While primarily an evergreen forest at the beginning, it transitions to more of an aspen forest and a recent burn area. The stands of silver trees make for fantastic flowers and birding. The meadows open up with a stunning panorama of flowers and rocky mountains.\r\n\nThe trail then alternates between burned forest and open meadows, then descends to Red Eagle Creek where it crosses over on a swinging bridge. More burned forest where it steeply climbs up the ridge, then back down to cross over the creek again.\r\n\nFrom here to the lake, the trail goes gently up and down through the burned forest. Wildflowers vary depending upon time of year. Woodpeckers and forest birds are abundant. The trail climbs a bit right before the lake with a wonderful overlook, then leads down to the campground at the foot of the lake, right along its shores. Looking across the lake is a real treat of tall mountain peaks in this crystal blue lake full of waterfowl and frequented by moose at the head.\r\n\nThis content was created by Jake Bramante of Hike 734.

The higher the trail climbs, the better the views of the peaks around you become. Continue for around 2.2 miles from the Florence Falls Trail, reaching the incredible shore of Gunsight Lake at the Gunsight Lake Campground. This is a great spot to take a break for lunch looking up to Gunsight Pass and the huge walls surrounding the lake. \r\n\nAt Gunsight Lake\u2019s outlet, the trail crosses a wooden bridge and continues to the right ( Jackson Glacier Trail heads to the left). The trail begins to switchback up Mt. Jackson\u2019s north face as the terrain begins to shift from dense vegetation to rockier, scree slopes. Be on the lookout for mountain goats and other alpine mammals like marmots in this rockier terrain. \r\n\nThe views of the emerald-colored Gunsight Lake get more incredible. The lake's color is due to the suspended particles of rock that were ground down by shifting glaciers. Across the lake, the south side of Gunsight Mountain features numerous cascades that plummet down its face. Be prepared for late-season snow crossings that require necessary gear such as an ice ax and crampons as you get closer to the shelter cabin at Gunsight Pass. \r\n\nComing to the top of Gunsight Pass, you'll get your first views of Lake Ellen Wilson and beyond into the west side of the park. From here, drop down the rocky slopes to a creek crossing at the base of a waterfall that can be flowing strongly, depending on the snowpack and time of year. The trail then bends around the north side of the lake and begins to climb for the final push towards Lincoln Pass. This area has frequent mountain goats that can be aggressive. \r\n\nFrom Lincoln Pass, head down along the switchbacks for close to a mile until you reach the historic Sperry Chalet. This is another great spot to take a break before.\r\n\nAfter Sperry Chalet, the trail heads down for another six miles or so in the trees first paralleling Sprague Creek, then crossing over the ridge to Snyder Creek.

It crosses Two Medicine Creek via a nice footbridge into some trees, briefly along the small Pray Lake, through some trees, then along the north shore of Two Medicine Lake.\r\n\nThe trail along the shore of Two Medicine Lake is a wonderful, level affair, bouncing between forest and avalanche chute giving you a nice balance of views and shade. \r\n\nNear the head of the lake, the trail breaks off, works its way through a large avalanche chute, then enters the forest and begins to climb. The climb is gradual at first, then it passes the Dawson Cutoff that heads to the boat dock and Upper Two Medicine Lake. Past the split, the trail spends more time in the open, but also climbs very steeply. Pumpelly Pillar Spire dominates the landscape which you frequently stop to enjoy as you catch your breath. You'll enter into more trees, and the trail levels off as you near the spur trail to No Name Lake and its campground.\r\n\nThe trail continues on into Bighorn Basin, so named for the sheep which are common in the area, so keep your eyes peeled as you climb. The trail transitions from trees and beargrass to predominately open meadows to rock. This transition comes quickly as you rapidly gain elevation. A look back down gives you a bird's eye view of Two Medicine Lake. After some switchbacks and elevation, the trail turns and makes its way towards Dawson Pass.\r\n\nThe reveal of the next drainage which is the headwaters of Nyack Creek, explodes into view at the pass. Both sides of the pass feature views which are an inspired delight to the eyes. Looking west, Mt. Phillips dominates the view with Mt. Stimson standing tall behind it to the north. \r\n\nFrom here, the trail works its way up a ridgeline off Flinsch Peak before turning back towards the west and wrapping around north towards Pitamakan Pass.

Morgan, an overlook of Oldman Lake and the Dry Fork drainage is fantastic. Keep an eye out for mountain goats below you along the cliffs.\r\n\nThe trail wraps around a couple of ridges of Mt.

Rocky summits stand guard all around. As you work your way up the steps of the boardwalk, more peaks come into view and you get a great view of the Garden Wall. When the road is first open to Logan Pass in the spring, most of this trail is on snow, but by mid-summer, it is a carpet of flowers of every color. Water flows from patches of snow that linger into the fall.\r\n\nThe trail gets closer to Clements Mountain and skirts a moraine and crosses numerous feeder streams that are to become Reynolds Creek below. The trail levels out at Hidden Pass with subalpine fir and pocket lakes. Mountain goats are frequent here and on the shoulders of the surrounding mountains. The trail gently goes to a platform at Hidden Lake Overlook which serves as the turning around point for many. Here, you look down at the beautiful Hidden Lake tucked beneath cliffs and backdropped by Bearhat Mountain. Interpretive signs help you pick out Sperry Glacier in the background.\r\n\nFrom here, the trail continues on dirt as it traverses fairly level terrain on the north side of the lake before hitting a switchback where the trail steeply descends to the lake in a flurry of switchbacks. At the bottom of the descent, the trail wanders to a pebbled shoreline and the outlet of the lake.

The southern half starts at Logan Pass and heads northwest 7.6 miles to Granite Park Chalet. The northern half continues 11.9 miles to its intersection with Waterton Valley and Flattop Mountain Trails.\r\n\nThe southern half is commonly done as a day outing, starting at Logan Pass and ending at The Loop via Granite Park Trail. You can park a second car at either end for the return trip or use the shuttle service. The views of McDonald Creek valley are constant and breathtaking. \r\n\nStarting from Logan Pass, follow the signs north across Going to the Sun Road to the trailhead. The trail goes through a meadow then hugs a series of cliffs on the slopes of the Garden Wall Divide. A cable bolted to the cliff wall is available during the summer, as the cliffs are sheer, but the trail is wide and this section is brief. The cliffs transition into steep, grassy slopes that you traverse for miles, occasionally crossing streams nice for resting and refilling water. After about 2.5 miles, you reach Big Bend, a rock field, then head uphill via switchbacks over a saddle on the east side of Haystack Butte. Fit hikers can take a detour to summit the butte. From the saddle, the trail continues its traverse with a gradual incline then shifts to a decline on its way to Granite Park Chalet. \r\n\nAbout a mile before the chalet the Garden Wall Trail splits off to the right and climbs sharply for a mile to an unbeatable overlook of Salamander and Grinnell Glaciers. Worth the detour for fit hikers. Those doing the day loop continue to the chalet (food & bathrooms available) then take Granite Park Trail 4.2 miles down to The Loop. Note that trail passes through a west-facing burn area that gets very hot and dry at a day's end.\r\n\nThe northern section of the trail is less frequented but equally spectacular. Several areas harbor snow late into the season that is sometimes impassable. Doing this section in a day via looping back on the Flattop Mountain Trail is arduous but possible if very fit. It is easier to camp at Fifty Mountain Campground and hike out the next day.\r\n\nFrom the chalet, the trail continues its traverse north toward Ahern Peak with great views of several drainages and mountain ridges. Just before the peak the trail turns sharp left at a junction with a short, steep spur up to Ahern Pass. The traverse continues around and up toward its terminus, with a final spur detour to an overlook of Sue Lake.\r\n\nVisit hike734.com for more expert Glacier content and maps that help you decide which trail to hike.", "features": "Fall Colors \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7018599/looking-at-granite-park-chalet-with-logan-pass-in-the-background", "ratings": {"rating": 4.7, "num_reviewers": 20}, "stats": {"dist": 19.9, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [7402, 5849], "alt-change": [3408, 3370], "avg-grade": 6.0, "max-grade": 34.0}},

This is the same route used by the early visitors who came over on the railroad.\r\n\nThe trail starts at Sun Point where an old chalet once sat. The views up and down St. Mary Lake are fantastic from this peninsula. From here it works its way along the shores of St. Mary Lake with fantastic views of the lake and the mountains backdropping it as it ducks in and out of trees. It then enters a recent burn as it veers away from the lake a bit and heads over to the foot of a wonderful waterfall called Baring Falls.\r\n\nYou continue on with some more great views of the lake and along the burn which has opened up more views, but can get hot in the summer. The trail reaches the junction with the St Mary Lake Trail that heads over to St. Mary/!Virginia Falls. It then heads up along the St. Mary River. It passes the trail to Gunsight Pass and continues on past Deadwood Falls. From there, the trail gains elevation as it works its way up to Going-to-the-Sun Road, crosses it, and continues to climb. \r\n\nFrom here, the forest is wet and the views are scant, even as you cross avalanche chutes. You pass the junction with the Siyeh Bend Trail (the most common access for Piegan Pass) and continue your climb. Views from the trail get better as the trees thin and get shorter. You cross Siyeh Creek and enter into the foot of Preston Park where the trail for Siyeh Pass takes off. As you continue your traverse, you pass through incredible flower meadows as the trees thin, eventually breaking above the trees and onto the rock.\r\n\nThe trail from here up to the pass offers incredible views all around and they continue to get better. At the pass, you get your first look down towards Many Glacier with sapphire blue tarns at the base of incredible cliffs. From here, the trail heads back down through the rock and down to terraced alpine hills below the cliffs.\r\n\nThe meadows begin gaining more trees and you pass the amazing Morning Eagle Falls and continue along Cataract Creek, crossing it twice, once as a ford with the other on a bridge. Views decrease as you enter a lush forest and drop down. A few intermittent views dot the forest to the hotel.\r\n\nThis content was created by Jake Bramante of Hike 734.

The stretch along the creek with small waterfalls and pools is sublime and a great place to have a snack. As it climbs further, it leaves the creek and begins alternating between trees and avalanche chutes as it climbs the walls of the cirque to reach the basin. The trail wraps west all the while getting better and better views.\r\n\nThe trail levels out as it enters the basin, spending most of its time traversing the rocky slopes just above the vegetation lining the creek. This portion of trail is fantastic, eventually dropping right along the creek and following it into the lake. Cutthroat trout can be seen spawning in this section of the creek early in summer.\r\n\nThe trail leads to the lake which is set beautifully in a great bowl.

Scrambling is needed for a good photo of the waterfall. \r\n\nFrom here, the trail begins to climb, but you've emerged from the forest and the views in every direction are fantastic. Old silver trees accent the brown shale of these disintegrating mountains. Everything in this terrain has a distressed look to it and it is beautiful. You have great views up to Mt. Henry and Appistoki Peak as well as down to Two Medicine Lake and the red mountains surrounding it.\r\n\nYou continue to climb and switchback up the mountain and eventually come to a saddle. Bighorn Sheep are frequently seen on this mountain and the neighboring mountains, but frequently cross at the saddle, so keep your eyes peeled.\r\n\nThe trail levels off and traverses across a steep face giving you a bird's eye view down the north face of the mountain. The trail continues across a broad, alpine slope full of low growing plants that flower into a carpet of every color. At the top, a spur trail breaks off to Scenic Point. This great vantage gives you views up to Two Medicine Lake, down to Lower Two Medicine Lake and out to the plains. Make sure that you have everything you want to keep tied down to your pack as the wind really whips up here.\r\n\nFrom here, the trail works its way out to East Glacier. The alpine trail comes to an edge and steeply follows this ridge down to Forty Mile Creek where you follow a canyon out to the foothills. The vegetation down here grows taller and lusher. Aspens begin popping up until you are navigating through aspen groves all the way to the boundary of the park.\r\n\nAt the boundary of the park, the trail gets a bit harder to follow as you are now on the reservation where more modes of travel are permitted and not regulated. Having a GPS here is a lifesaver. The trail continues on through more of the same to the town of East Glacier Park.\r\n\nThis content was created by Jake Bramante of Hike 734.

The trail follows the creek upstream, sometimes right along the water, sometimes away from it, and sometimes high above looking down. You pass wonderful vistas of Bad Marriage Mountain and views up the drainage to Razoredge Mountain and Medicine Grizzly Peak while passing willow-lined sections of the creek and ponds.\r\n\nAt four miles, you pass the junction with the Triple Divide that also leads to Medicine Grizzly Lake. From here, the trail turns up the drainage towards Morningstar Lake through the trees, passing a meadow that is a favorite for elk in the evening. The trail wraps around the base of the mountain, following up the creek gaining elevation until it gets to Morningstar Lake with it's campground. Views up to the red rock ridge line often have white spots of goats hanging on its ledges.\r\n\nFrom here, the trail gains elevation more quickly, passes by Katoya Lake at a distance, then crosses over the outlet of the incredibly lovely Pitamakan Lake as the views up towards Pitamakan Pass and Mt. Morgan are stunning.\r\n\nYou follow the shores of this lake that is tucked beneath cliffs, passing Seven Winds of the Lake, then begin steeply switchbacking up to fantastic alpine meadows that are favorites of bighorn sheep. The trail joins up with the Dawson Pass trail that leads around the western edge of Mt. Morgan as well as the Cut Bank Pass Trail.\r\n\nThe Pitamakan Pass Trail follows along the ridge east with incredible views down the Cut Bank drainage that you climbed up with the sapphire lakes capping off the beauty. Looking down the south side of the slope, Oldman Lake sits at the bottom of the valley surrounded by the steep cliffs of Flinsch Peak and Rising Wolf.\r\n\nYou switchback down to Oldman Lake. You're back in the trees with stands of old, silver snags creating a dramatic contrast to the new, green growth. This trail follows Dry Fork Creek out the drainage towards the plains that seem to go on forever. Looks down into the drainage can reward you with all sorts of wildlife.\r\n\nThe trail eventually crosses the creek which is a trickle by mid-summer.

It passes a nice spur trail out to Paradise Point, then heads southwest past a few ponds and wetland areas which gives you an opportunity to see both moose and mosquitos. From there, the trail finds a drier forest as it passes the spur trail for Aster Park. \r\n\nThe trail continues on through the trees paralleling the south shore of Two Medicine which remains out of view. Pocket meadows give you views of the surrounding mountains. A trail breaks off to the right that fords the creek. Continue on along Paradise Creek to a bridged crossing, then pass the Two Medicine Pass Trail which branches to the south, as this trail begins to work north. \r\n\nAt this point, the trail begins to climb over a ridge coming off of Mt. Sinopah as it traverses its flanks. Once at the top of this little ridge, you have great views of the lake and can often see the vintage tour boat tugging across the lake. You traverse a wide open avalanche chute with even more unobstructed views, eventually dropping down into trees and passing the boat dock spur trail.\r\n\nFrom here, the trail turns west and begins working up towards Upper Two Medicine Lake. It enters an older forest for a bit before popping out in another avalanche chute where it meets up with the Dawson Cutoff Trail that heads along the north shore of the lake. Continue on west where it wraps around through more forest, past the short spur trail to the beautiful Twin Falls.\r\n\nPast that spur trail, the trail skirts the ridgeline that makes up the Pumpelly Pillar on the edge of the treeline. It follows Two Medicine Creek upstream with great views. It passes a small pond before the lake that gives another opportunity to glimpse a moose. From there the trail climbs the short distance up to the lovely Upper Two Medicine Lake.

While the 7 miles to the pass could be done as a day hike (and that may be easier on your knees), many people tackle it as part of a trip into the backcountry. From this trail, you have access to the Cobalt Lake, Upper Park Creek, and Lake Isabel campgrounds. For rules and guidelines regarding backcountry camping in Glacier, refer to their website.\r\n\nStarting from the South Shore Trail of Two Medicine Lake, you'll pass several other side trails along the way (Paradise Point, Aster Park, Aster Falls) before you reach a suspension bridge. After the suspension bridge, you'll come upon the junction for Two Medicine Pass, or Twin Falls and Upper Two Medicine Lake. Take the left trail towards Two Medicine Pass, and you'll soon come upon Rockwell Falls. \r\n\nOver the next two miles after Rockwell Falls, the trail really begins to climb. You'll also be passing through some great huckleberry bushes, so make some noise to let bears know you're there! Before you know it, you've reached Cobalt Lake. Most hikers on this trail turn around here, but you'll push forward to reach the pass itself. It's another mile and a half of switchbacks to reach the ridge, and there the views begin to open up. \r\n\nBe prepared, as this ridge is famous for being one of the windiest parts of the park. Keep any loose things tied down, and then you can enjoy the views into the Park Creek area and Mt. Saint Nicholas in the distance. From here, you can either continue down to Upper Park Creek campground, another two miles away or return to the Two Medicine Area.

After crossing over Quarter Circle Bridge, the road works its way along the Middle Fork Flathead River and briefly climbs. Before it turns north, you'll see the trailhead on the left side of the road.\r\n\nThe trail is an old road leading to the ranger station, so much of it is wide and level. You spend a lot of time bouncing in and out of a recent burn which makes for some nice forest birding. While you are close to the Middle Fork, you don't really get many views. Because of the fires, expect to encounter some downfall. Views of the Apgar Mountains are nice, but don't make for very good photos due to the standing burned trees. \r\n\nYou'll pass a couple of small feeder streams and then climb up onto a rocky outcropping before heading back down with a brief view of the river. Visitors will then enjoy a traverse that levels out through the open burn. You then come to the edge of a drop-off down to the river below with nice views. The trail continues from there to the old Ranger Station site, which was burned in the fire. From this vantage point, there are great views of the confluence of the North Fork and the Middle Fork of the Flathead River.\r\n\nFrom here the trail travels through more burn, but also spends more time through older stands of trees. Water from a spring often floods a section of the trail which requires some tricky bushwhacking to keep your shoes dry. Beyond that, it's more of the same until you come to a section of inholdings that were parceled out, but never developed. An old burned log structure remains. From here you duck back into the forest until you come to the river.\r\n\nThe trail is most often done as an out and back to the old ranger station site. This is one of the few trails in Glacier that allows mountain biking and, now that they have kept up on some of the downfall, it's a doable affair, but can become a challenge with more being blown down all the time and the new trees encroaching on the trail.\r\n\nThis content was created by Jake Bramante of Hike 734.

It traverses a great bowl surrounded by rocks that are layered red, brown, and gray. As you traverse, water falls down the rock walls with the largest one, the beautiful Akaiyan Falls serving as the notification that you're about to climb.\r\n\nFrom here, the trail switchbacks up the rocks to get up on the rock headwall. Once up on top of this wall, you make your way through a hall of erratics carried by the glacier and randomly set like a giant chess board in mid-play. The trail crosses over the outlet of Feather Woman Lake which keeps ice in it most of summer. Its beauty in on display as you gain elevation to the west of it with great vantages looking down.\r\n\nAll around you are distressed rock walls telling the geologic story of massive uplift evident in Edwards Mountain and Gunsight Mountain. This trail continues up towards another headwall and Comeau Pass.\r\n\nBefore you get there, you pass Akaiyan Lake, another lake similar to Feather Woman Lake. Once past that lake, you skirt the cliff above the lake, then begin to switchback up to the pass. \r\n\nOnce at the headwall, you come to the notch carved out with a wonderful staircase and a cable handrail put in years ago to accommodate climbers up to the glacier. Once up at Comeau Pass, panoramic views are stunning. Rocky peaks stand tall in all directions. The Flathead Valley and civilization is visible from the pass, but turn around towards the glacier and snow, ice, rocks and small tarns or ponds in colors of emerald and turquoise that sit in the basins below the glaciers.\r\n\nLook out for the mountain goats in this area as they have been a bit habituated to people and can be a bit aggressive.\r\n\nFrom here, the \"trail\" is a series of cairns with signs on them. You reach them by crossing over the snowfields. At the end of these crossings, you can look up towards the glacier and see crevasses, blue ice, and other such classic glacier features.

Filtered views of Lake McDonald as well as a nice variety of flowers and birds make for nice breaks while you climb. Once at the top of the ridge, you realize why this area is less visited despite being close to the busy Going-to-the-Sun Road. The climb is nothing to sneeze at! \r\n\nFrom here, the trail traverses the ridgeline that borders old and new stands of trees. It then drops down on the north side of the ridge, dropping into the Camas Creek drainage through a wetter forest with older stands of trees with moss. Occasional views of Rogers Lake and Rogers Peak give a hint of the scenery in the valley down below.\r\n\nAfter dropping approximately 1,000 feet, you pass the junction with the Camas Creek Trail and continue on to the foot of the long and beautiful Trout Lake. A large log jam at the foot of the lake tempts you to work your way across. Continue along the trail that follows the south shore of the lake, never straying far from the lake as you pass wooded areas and avalanche chutes.  Few people stray onto this trail, but frequent bear scat lets you know you aren't alone despite the remote feeling. \r\n\nThe trail continues to the head of the lake where it climbs up over a ridge to a large avalanche chute where views of the surrounding mountains are spectacular. Camas Creek and Arrow Lake are also visible as you move towards the campground. \r\n\nFrom the campground on the shores of the lake, you ford Camas Creek to continue on. This ford can be a bit sketchy in the spring making the next section more palatable when the creek goes down and the snow has melted out more further up the trail.\r\n\nFollow along the northwest edge of the lake and cross the creek as it enters the lake. Keep crossing the feeder creeks and keep an eye to the north for orange markers that guide you to the obvious trail that continues through the meadows. At the end of the large meadow, the trail is frequently fairly overgrown with vegetation such as thimbleberries. Make sure to make plenty of noise from this point on due to low visibility and frequent grizzlies. \r\n\nThe trail begins to climb up along Camas Creek which is playfully bubbling over rocks. As you gain elevation and cross the creek again, the views open up as you enter the open alpine. The trail turns up the drainage to Camas Creek.

You cross over a lovely creek and the views are great, but are filtered through silver tree snags still standing. This area also offers little protection from the sun and, in the afternoon, can be blistering hot for those coming down after taking the shuttle to the top and pairing this trail with the Highline Trail. \r\n\nThe trail begins to wrap around the rounded ridge giving you views of Flattop Mountain as you begin to climb. This area contains many shrubs with berries and is popular with black bears and grizzlies, so keep your eyes peeled and make plenty of noise. The silver trees gradually begin to give way to open meadows and the trail spends more time on the edge of steeper terrain freeing the views up from the silver snags to more open views. The higher up you go, the more expansive the views are.\r\n\nThe trail comes to a nice switchback with great views up alpine meadows before crossing through tall shrubs, then into the unburned stands of subalpine fir. From here, the forest is cooler and has pocket meadows in addition to the trees. This change of habitat adds to the number of flora and fauna species while giving you respite from the sun.\r\n\nEventually, you work your way just below Granite Park Chalet. The Granite Park Campground Trail splits to the left and you continue right and see the old chalet. The trail pops out along a nice ridge with fantastic views looking south to Logan Pass with Heavens Peak dominating the views to the west.

You begin your journey along a rustic dirt road (rustic even for dirt road standards) all the way to the train tracks. Safely cross the train tracks and look for an official trailhead marker and begin making your way on a well maintained trail.\r\n\nThis trail weaves its way through a wonderful lodgepole and aspen forest with a few nice creeks until you get to the patrol cabin and the junction with the Elk Mountain trail. Continue on the trail through more lodgepole forests where it drops down to Ole Creek. From there, you ford the creek which can be dangerous early in the season.\r\n\nOn the other side of the creek, the trail steeply climbs up the ridge through a forest with limited views then back down steeply through more of the same. From the creek junction all the way to the Coal Creek Trail, the trail is one of the last in this park unit to receive trail maintenance, thus can be a huge collection of downfall. The trail alternates between dropping and steeply dropping down to the Park Creek Trail. Here, you have another ford which tends to be pretty tame later in the year, but can be hazardous during spring runoff.\r\n\nAfter fording Park Creek, you work your way back up through more forest. It has another steep section as it descends to Muir Creek which the trail crosses. The trail then gently follows Muir Creek with a couple of small meadows. This remote section receives very little human contact and is a great place for solitude.\r\n\nThe trail departs from Muir Creek and begins climbing the ridge between Double Mountain and Mt. St. Nicholas. Towards the top of the ridge, you encounter the burn from the Coal Creek drainage and get some cool views of one of Glacier's more interesting mountains in Mt. St. Nicholas. The last little bit of the trail cresting the ridge is steep and is also steep on the way down. Finding the trail is a little tricky on the way down to the crossing of Coal Creek. Once again, this is a ford, but you may be able to cross over some fallen logs to get to the Coal Creek Trail. \r\n\nOverall, it's an adventure of a trip requiring some route finding, lots of elevation change, and plenty of navigation of downfall.", "features": "Fall Colors \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7017146/ole-creek-crossing-in-the-fall", "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 15.8, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [5828, 3919], "alt-change": [3803, 4576], "avg-grade": 10.0, "max-grade": 34.0}},

Follow the South Boundary Trail west and, at a small rise, the trail takes off at an unmarked junction with a faint trail. Having a GPS or using the Hiking Project mobile app is very nice as you can be looking for this junction.\r\n\nFrom here, the trail gains elevation on a southwestern facing slope. This area was a former burn, so you can see out, and the mountains in the Middle Fork drainage across the river are fantastic. As you climb, the trail wraps up on a ridge and looks down on a little pocket lake called Halfmoon Lake. \r\n\nFrom there it traverses the hillside on a mostly level section bordering an unburned section of trees, before beginning its ascent in earnest. The trail has a few switchbacks as it works up the mountain's west slope and traverses through more of a burned forest. Views continue to open up with the views of the mint green Harrison Lake being particularly noteworthy as you approach the top. \r\n\nAt the switchback that heads back south, you get some great views of Walton Mountain backdropped by the mighty Mount Jackson. This is just a tease as you work your way back south and wrap around the mountain, entering wonderful alpine terrain with some trees dotting grassy slopes. The trail travels through the double summits at the top and wraps around the actual summit like a snail's shell.\r\n\nViews from the summit are absolutely fantastic.

Sofa Mountain to the northwest and Sarcee Mountain to the west create rocky backdrops to a beautiful, lush drainage.\r\n\nThe trail drops along the contours of the mountain until you get to a seasonal creek bed. A pile of rocks across the old trail serve as the indicator to just follow the newer trail along the top of the north ridge above the creek bed. This drops down through meadows and into some trees as you get to the bottom and the river's edge.\r\n\nThe trail used to ford the river and continue along the river up to the Miche Wabum Lake, but has now been abandoned and it is an epic bushwhack to the lake.\r\n\nThis content was created by Jake Bramante of Hike 734.

Along the way, you travel between open meadows and avalanche chutes with views of the incredible, jagged, rocky summits of the drainages, through wonderful, forests as well as following along the lakeshores. The change of views and habitats keep the way interesting. Keep your eyes peeled for deer, moose, and bears that live in the drainage.\r\n\nAfter passing two lakes with three fantastic campgrounds, you'll travel close to the head of Glenns Lake and pass the junction of the Mokowanis Lake Trail, quickly followed by the least desirable campground in the trees at Mokowanis Junction.\r\n\nFrom here, the trail begins to gain elevation as it follows the Mokowanis River which is more of a cascading creek creating a long waterfall that keeps you company as you hike. A series of switchbacks bring you into the alpine and onto a shelf with the lovely Atsina Lake. Up here, the walls of the mountains are wonderful and close. Small feeder streams come from above as waterfalls. You work your way around Atsina Lake and ford the river, then continue to follow it on its south side before switchbacking up on the hillside to get above the cliffs that Paiota Falls fan out over. Turning around gives you a stunning view of Atsina Lake and the Mokowanis drainage spreading out before you.\r\n\nThe trail heads right above the falls where you ford the river once again. This basin is the true headwaters where waterfalls both named and unnamed come from Sue Lake and Shepard Glacier above and out of view. \r\n\nThe trail continues up the basin past pocket ponds and pikas, finally switchbacking up the headwall to Stoney Indian Pass. From the pass, you have breathtaking views in both directions. Below you, Stoney Indian Lake sits perched above the valley below. You drop into this basin through steep switchbacks to the lake and follow the shores to its outlet and the campground.\r\n\nFrom here, the trail follows Pass Creek down as the low growing alpine vegetation turns to tall alder and subalpine fir, then taller trees as you descend all of the way to the valley floor and join up with the Waterton Valley Trail.\r\n\nThis content was created by Jake Bramante of Hike 734.

For a good picnic spot, turn right and follow the trail for about a quarter of a mile to an open alpine meadow, filled to bursting with wildflowers all through the spring and summer. Hikers can either turn around at the junction and head back the way they came, or follow the CDT in either direction. For a longer day hike with huge rewards, turn right at the junction and follow the CDT for 4.5 miles to Lewis and Clark Pass, then back down to the trailhead.

Starting from the Alice Creek Trail, this extra-wide trail follows an old road that was the most popular way of crossing the Continental Divide in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.You'll begin in a recently burned conifer forest at the base of the trail, filled with Heartleaf Arnica flowers that bloom during the summer. \r\n\nThe trail begins to climb after roughly 0.3 miles, into grasslands and sparse pine trees, with beautiful views of the valley floor below. Ground squirrel nests greet you as you hike along, as well as deer and elk that graze in the area. Halfway to the top of the trail, a small freshwater spring crosses the trail, providing a chance for hikers to fill up any water bottles. \r\n\nHikers once again enter a burned stand of trees, before climbing up into a grassy area on slope of the valley. In the late spring and early summer, these grasslands host abundant wildflowers in a huge array of colors. Common species to see are Howard's Alpine Forget-Me-Not, Larkspur, Sagebrush Buttercup, Pussytoes, and Milkvetches, and be on the lookout for small light-blue flowers of Missoula Phlox, a rare treat for flower enthusiasts. \r\n\nWhen you reach the top of the rise, you are greeted with spectacular vistas of the Eastern Rocky Mountains, and a large sign proclaiming the historical significance of the site; Merriwether Lewis crossed the Continental Divide at this spot on his return journey from the Pacific Coast to the East in 1806. Beyond the sign is an open meadow that is the perfect spot to have a picnic and appreciate the scenery.\r\n\nDRIVING DIRECTIONS: From Lincoln take MT-200 East approximately 10 miles to Alice Creek Road. Turn left onto the road and follow signs for the Alice Creek Trail, about 10 miles. The road is paved to start but quickly becomes a gravel road, so be advised if you have a low-clearance car.

In reality, it is composed of 3 remaining hikeable sections with miles of highway, forest service roads and farm roads connecting the three. As of Nov 2017, these 3 sections will provide you with 78.4 miles of \"Rail Trail\". \r\n\nYou can expect beautiful wooded areas on the northern end and waves of farmland and a few tressels on the Southern end of the Rail Trail. You can also expect to enjoy an ever-changing view of the Teton Mountain Range. \r\n\nThe Oregon Pacific Rail lines were established to provide tourist access to the Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks in 1908 and 1913. \r\n\nThe hiking surface is dirt and gravel but obviously, maintain easy RR grades throughout. \r\n\nThis section: Handy bathroom and lots of parking separate this section from the others. Head southwest on the remains of the RR bed. South Fork Road will join you and provide an occasional dust cloud for a few miles. Cross over Black Canyon Loop Road and Big Springs Loop Road just before coming to Henry\"s Fork trestle. \r\n\nAs you climb up the river bank the trail turns into a snake for 0.25 mile. (I know, how can that be? It just is) Keep going. You'll see Big Springs Loop Road again and parallel Trude Road for miles before crossing it. Next, pass Rainbow Road in Island Park. Now hike straight as an arrow for miles. Turn ever so slightly so you are going south to Eccles. Don't blink, it is only a road and a clearing now. \r\n\nPress on to Pineview where you'll again cross Eccles Road and the headwaters of the Warm River. Big surprise, you'll cross Warm River Road three times on the way to Gerrit, home of a horse corral.

The hike begins closely following the course of Kootenai Creek to the south of the trail with deep-cut canyon views and the beautiful sound of a pristine waterway. \r\n\nAt about the 3.5 mile mark the trail crosses into the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness and weaves slightly northward and away from the creek. You'll traverse through variable terrain ranging from course rocky trail and narrow sections of rock screes to flat riparian earth.

They used it to travel along the park\u2019s northern boundary, sneaking across the line to hunt elk. The elk meat ironically was sold to the U.S. Cavalry who were there to protect wildlife from poachers. The National Forest Service now maintains the trail (NFS Trail #98) which is sometimes called the NFS Buffalo Plateau Trail.\r\n\nThe Poachers Trail begins from a lovely meadow on Buffalo Creek just north of Yellowstone National Park, at a junction with the Buffalo Fork Trail, 7.5 miles from its trailhead in Slough Creek\u2019s First Meadow. The Poachers Trail ends at a junction with the Coyote Creek Trail, 6 miles from its trailhead near Hellroaring Creek. \r\n\nThe Poachers Trail climbs 1800 feet through heavily burned forests to the top of the Buffalo Plateau in the first 3 miles. Watch closely for the trail on the ground, it may be difficult to follow in spots. Just prior to the top of the plateau, the trail passes a trail junction on the left with Yellowstone\u2019s Buffalo Plateau Trail. From the top you get nice views both east (of the Buffalo Creek drainage) and west (of the Coyote Creek drainage). The trail then drops 1800 feet in the next 3.8 miles to join the Coyote Creek Trail.   \r\n\nParts of the Poachers Trail can be used to make several long loop or shuttle routes down Yellowstone's Buffalo Plateau Trail:\r\n\nThe eastern half of the Poachers Trail can be used as part of a 22-mile shuttle from Slough Creek Campground to Hellroaring Trailhead. Take the Slough Creek Trail (or the Soldiers Trail) 2 miles to the First Meadow, then follow the Buffalo Fork Trail 7.5 miles to just north of the park, there pick up the Poachers Trail for 2.6 miles to the top of Buffalo Plateau, then follow the Buffalo Plateau Trail 8.6 miles south to a junction with Hellroaring Creek Trail, and take the last 1.5 miles out to the Hellroaring Trailhead. \r\n\nThe western half of the Poachers Trail can be used as part of a 20-mile loop from the Hellroaring Trailhead. Start on the first 1.5 miles of the Hellroaring Creek Trail, then a short .5-mile section of the Buffalo Plateau Trail to the Coyote Creek Trailhead, then the first 6 miles of Coyote Creek Trail to a junction with the Poachers Trail, then 4.2 miles up the Poachers Trail to the Buffalo Plateau Trail, and follow it 8.6 miles back to the Hellroaring Creek Trail and out.\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

There is no camping allowed near the lake. If you have an adventurous spirit, long pants and a map, bushwhack your way to Upper Cold Lake. Keep in mind that any trails leading away from the end of Trail #121 at the first viewpoint of Lower Cold Lake are not maintained by the US Forest Service. \r\n\nThe trail is of moderate grade and climbs about 800 feet (most of this is in the first mile). During fall, some sections of the trail are brushy and while easily passable are best done with long pants.\r\n\nAt Cold Lake, the landscape opens up to a beautiful mountain cirque and towering cliffs, where mountain goats may be seen.  Around the shore, there are nice rocks for sitting and eating your lunch or taking a few casts in the lake. Kids enjoy clambering over dead fall and rocks. The lake is crystal clear and cold, as the name suggests. Camping is not permitted within 0.25 miles of either of the Cold Lakes shorelines, so probably not the greatest choice for an overnight adventure. There are fish in this lake, but you'll need a watercraft if you hope to cast many flies as there is minimal open shoreline available.\r\n\nSchool-aged children can hike this trail, but may need some bribes during the first half mile or so as the trail is steep, and it is why I would not recommend the trail for younger children or those with bad knees. After the first third, the trail levels out and descends a bit to the lake.\r\n\nThe trailhead is 5 miles up a well maintained dirt road. Less than a mile in, the road crosses the Swan River where two unimproved campsites can be found.  The river during late summer and fall is a great place to explore with kids as the flows are low and there are many gravel \"islands\". Take care crossing every bridge after the main Swan River as there are potholes on both sides of the bridge that can sneak up on you, especially if you are not driving a truck. There is a small parking lot at the trailhead and a nice outhouse.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 Fishing \u00b7 Lake \u00b7 Swimming \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7080439/cold-lake-well-worth-the-hike-up", "ratings": {"rating": 4.0, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 1.8, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [5811, 5113], "alt-change": [722, 79], "avg-grade": 8.0, "max-grade": 22.0}},

I have never heard anyone call it either of those. We simply call the 313.\r\n\nTo begin, the trail tends to continue climbing with dramatic drop offs to your right. At 4.5 miles there is an impressive couloir descending to an unnamed lake.  At 5.0 miles is the junction with Skalkaho-Gird Trail, which would eventually take you over to the Palisade Trail and Willow Creek trails. One day if we can get the resources for maintenance, it could be a fun option. For now be content to stay on 313.\r\n\nThe trail tops out on the top of Dome Shaped Mountain at 8650 ft and 6.6 miles. Before you get there, the trail takes a quick steep dive through some loose rock. Be careful. I took a tumble here, and from personal experience an injury here is not welcome. After the quick taste of things to come, there is more climbing as the trail becomes rocky and skirts a steep east facing bowl.\r\n\nTake awhile to enjoy the views at the top and check out the Burnt Fork drainage, your eventual destination.\r\n\nAfter topping out, the reward is mile of descending, another mile of relatively flat ridgeline, and the more downhill. At mile 10, the trail enters a recent burn, and if you are lucky the trail has been cleared, otherwise good luck. The fire burned all the lichen and moss off the granite boulders, leaving them a stark white contrasting with the surrounding blackened trees. The effect is surreal as the trail seems to weave over and around tombstones and crypts.\r\n\nLeaving the burn behind the trail begins climbing again, and a steep section awaits you for the last major climb up to Eagle Point.

Hikers take off from the Indian Meadows Trailhead along the Mainline Trail, passing through young pine and aspen forest along relatively flat terrain. The trail gradually climbs before the first junction with the Heart Lake Trail, where hikers can either head directly to the lake, or continue onwards to the second junction with the trail and make it a loop. Be on the lookout while you go for deer, elk, eagles, and bear, all of which frequent the area during the warmer months and into the fall. The trail is open to both hikers and stock, and is heavily trafficked during the summer, so be courteous and remember to share the trail. The Heart Lake Trail itself offers spectacular views, well-maintained campsites, and plenty of fishing opportunities to day hikers and backpackers alike. There is a restroom available halfway along the lake, as well as one at the trailhead. For a longer hike, the Heart Lake Trail meets up with the Lone Mountain Trail midway along its path as well, and heads up and over the mountain and back to Indian Meadows. This is a great way to experience both lakeside relaxation and mountain vistas in a single hike. \r\n\nDRIVING DIRECTIONS: From Lincoln take MT-200 East approximately 6.5 miles to Copper Creek Road. Turn left onto the road and follow signs for Copper Creek Campground/Indian Meadows Trailhead, about 8 miles. At the fork in the road, take the righthand road and continue on until the Indian Meadows Trailhead. There is ample parking and separate stock trailer/stock parking, as well as a restroom at the trailhead. Follow signs for Mainline Trail for the starting point of the hike.", "features": "Fishing \u00b7 Lake \u00b7 Swimming \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "ratings": {"rating": 4.0, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 2.6, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [6494, 6033], "alt-change": [630, 326], "avg-grade": 7.0, "max-grade": 18.0}},

Starting at the Arrastra Creek Trailhead, hikers gradually climb through conifer forests and open meadows, with breathtaking views of the surrounding mountain slopes. \r\n\nThe trail itself is relatively straight, but beware of blind corners, as this is major bear country; be sure to make plenty of noise and always carry bear spray. Besides bears, hikers have ample opportunity to spot other types of fauna, including elk, deer, rabbits, butterflies, and eagles. From late spring through mid-summer, hikers will be treated to a spectacular wildflower display. \r\n\nTwice during the hike the trail crosses Arrastra Creek, so be sure to use extra caution during high water season. Just before the second crossing, a crossroad with the 3.1 mile-long Porcupine Basin Trail is available to hikers looking for a longer day trip. Another option is to go the full 8 miles into the Bob Marshall Wilderness; the trail hooks up with the Dry Creek and Mainline Trails, which grants a hiker access to all the trails in the protected area. \r\n\nDIRECTIONS\r\nFrom Lincoln take MT-200 West approximately 1.3 miles to Beaver Creek Road.

Sweeping mountain and valley views can be seen from several points along the trail, and lynx are known to frequent the area, so be on the lookout for any signs of tracks, particularly in the early spring when snow still covers the ground. The trail ends in an open meadow, with plenty of space for picnics and backcountry camping, and connects with an old mining road. Hikers can either head back along the trail from here to complete the day, or continue onwards along the road to the second trail of the hike. Heading south on this road for about a half of a mile brings visitors to the start of the Sauerkraut Trail, which descends a narrow valley through cool, thickly-forested terrain. \r\n\nDRIVING DIRECTIONS: From Lincoln take MT-200 to Dalton Mountain Road, approximately 3 miles. Turn left and follow the road for approximately 8 miles, until a sign on the righthand side of the road that points towards Trail 404. Turn right onto the dirt road just beyond the sign, and drive to the end, where the trailhead begins. This side road is heavily rutted, so low-clearance cars should park on the shoulder of the main road instead", "features": "Views \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7061287/view-of-the-lincoln-valley", "ratings": {"rating": 4.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 4.5, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [6576, 6243], "alt-change": [512, 419], "avg-grade": 4.0, "max-grade": 10.0}},

The trail cuts downwards through a conifer and aspen forest, with several open meadow-like areas. From early spring through summer, wildflowers can be found blooming both along the path and in these meadows. The most common flowers to see are Indian Paintbrush, Bear Grass, and Lupine varieties. Birdwatching is also plentiful for visitors to the area. \r\n\nThe trail ends at Sauerkraut Creek, where a small footbridge leads across the stream to a campsite on the other side. To see the namesake wall, hikers can cross the bridge and cut through the campsite to an old logging road on the opposite side. Turn left and follow the road south past an abandoned cabin, and the wall can be seen bordering the nearside of the stream. The wall itself was built in the early 1900s by Chinese immigrants, and serves as an artificial levee for the stream during spring floods. \r\n\nAll in all, the Sauerkraut Wall Trail is a good day hike for anyone looking for a quick and easy adventure and features scenic views, plentiful flora and fauna, and a firsthand view of some local history.\r\n\nDIRECTIONS: \r\nFrom Lincoln, take MT-200 to Dalton Mountain Road, approximately 3 miles.

There\u2019s a nice campsite here too, but no fish.\r\n\nFrom Crescent Lake the trail climbs another 200 feet, then drops slightly and passes a small pond. At the 2.2-mile mark the trail begins another 700 foot climb over 2.3 miles to the park boundary. At the 3.6-mile mark the trail climbs up and over a ridge and the views both east and west are outstanding. As you continue, notice the mix of trees has shifted. In addition to spruce and fir trees, there now are distinctive five-needled whitebark pine. Unfortunately, most of the whitebarks are dead or dying. Drought conditions in the Northern Rockies made mature whitebarks susceptible to attack by mountain pine bark beetles. The death of this mature forest is a blow to Yellowstone\u2019s grizzly population, that depend heavily on nutrient-rich whitebark pine nuts for food in the fall. \r\n\nAt 4.5 miles the boundary is reached and the views are spectacular. Impressive Lion Creek Canyon lies out of the park to the north, and the Gallatin Range stretches out to the southeast. The next 1.5 miles the trail travels on or near the park boundary and drops 600 feet to the banks of High Lake. This is the highlight of the trip! At one time, this ridge lay outside the park. In the early 1920s plans were made to dramatically expand the park. These high hopes never completely materialized, but out of them came Grand Teton National Park and several Yellowstone boundary changes. In 1927 this northwest corner of the park was expanded to include the Gallatin Petrified Forest and winter grazing grounds for a large elk heard. \r\n\nAt 6 miles, the lovely 7-acre High Lake is reached. At 8774 feet, I'd say it's well named. Though only 18 feet deep, it sports a healthy population of cutthroat trout. And there are two nice campsites. From the lake the trail continues south, briefly leaving the park, then turns right and follows the East Fork of Specimen Creek the final 4 miles as it drops another 700 feet to its junction with the Sportsman Lake Trail. From here it's another 6.7 miles to the Specimen creek Trailhead on U.S. 191.\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

This delightful trail leads through open sagebrush meadows along Dailey Creak to its source and ends at Dailey Pass, where it intersects the Sky Rim Trail and NFS Dailey Pass Trail.\r\n\nFrom the trailhead the trail quickly crosses tiny Dailey Creek and follows it as it bends left around formidable Crown Butte. The trail continues north, gently rising through beautiful open meadows, passing a junction with the Black Butte-Dailey Creek Cutoff Trail (on right) at 1.9 miles and the Dailey Creek Spur Trail (on left) at 2.8 miles. \r\n\nAs you get further and further up Dailey Creek, the wall of mountains that hems in the valley on the north and east becomes more and more imposing. The top of this ridge is the irregular shaped boundary to Yellowstone. At one time, the ridge and this valley lay outside the park boundary. In the early 1920s, plans were made to dramatically expand the park by annexing among others:  Jackson Hole to the south; the Wapiti Valley to the east; and even the snowy Beartooth Mountains. Of course, these high hopes never completely materialized, but out of them came Grand Teton National Park and several Yellowstone boundary changes. In 1927 this northwest corner of the park was expanded to include the Gallatin Petrified Forest and winter grazing grounds for a large elk herd.  \r\n\nAt the 3.6-mile mark the trail enters the trees and begins a 900-foot climb to Dailey Pass in the final 1.4 miles. The pass straddles the boundary between Yellowstone National Park and Custer Gallatin National Forest. Dailey Pass, cluttered with trail signs and boundary markers, is a major 4-way intersection between Yellowstone's Sky Rim and Dailey Creek trails and the NFS Dailey Pass Trail. A left turn follows the final mile of the Sky Rim Trail as it traces the park\u2019s extreme northwestern boundary then continues out of the park on NFS Trail #100 along \u201cOne Day Ridge\u201d to Teepee Creek.

The trail ends at the top of Sheep Mountain the highest mountain in this area, about a mile east of the trail\u2019s junction with the Specimen Creek Trail. Both the beginning and the end of this trail are many miles from a highway.\r\n\nThe first mile to Dailey Pass follows a swath cut through the trees marking the park boundary. Look for interesting YNP boundary markers carved into trees along the way. Dailey Pass is a major 4-way backcountry intersection. A right turn is Yellowstone\u2019s Dailey Creek Trail, which drops 1600 feet in 5 miles to highway US 191. A left turn is the NFS Dailey Pass Trail NFS #57. The Sky Rim Trail continues straight along the ridge and climbs 600 feet and takes a right turn at a junction with the Tom Minor Divide Trail at 1.7 miles. From there, the views in every direction are spectacular, and they stay that way for miles and miles.\r\n\nAs you head SE along the flower-spangled ridge, look to the horizon on the east for the rounded mountain with the huge metal structure on top \u2013 that\u2019s Sheep Mountain, the end of the Sky Rim! Beginning around 2 miles, look for short side trails to the right that lead to nice views and a chance to see fossilized trees (part of the Gallatin Petrified Forest). \r\n\nThe trail rolls up and down (mostly up) and has three big hills to climb (beginning at 2.9, 4.3, & 5.8 miles) on the way to Big Horn Peak. Just after the second climb, the trail levels and disappears into a big meadow. Continue south and watch for trail markers on the far side of the meadow. The trail also is hard to find as you steeply climb the third hill; just keep climbing and you\u2019ll find it.\r\n\nAt 6.4 miles (the top of the third hill), the Black Butte Trail junction is passed. The next .3 miles of the Sky Rim to Big Horn Peak (9930') is the real crux of the trail. Here the trail winds through a rocky section with precipitous drop-offs and awesome views. There is no more spectacular scenery anywhere in Yellowstone! \r\n\nFrom Big Horn Peak, the trail continues along the ridge dropping 600 feet in the next 3 miles and passing the Specimen Creek Trail (just above Shelf Lake). The final mile of the Sky Rim Trail climbs 780 feet along the ridge to the top of Sheep Mountain (10095'). The huge metal communication screen on top is called a \u201cmicroflector.\u201d\r\n\nThanks to guidebook author, Tom Carter, for sharing this trail description.

About 1/2 mile past the junction, in the open dirt bluffs above the trail to the left, are excellent examples of petrified trees for which Specimen Creek is named.

To reach the trailhead from the Tom Miner Campground, take the Buffalo Horn Trail 3 miles (up 1600 feet) to the pass. The Divide Trail runs south along the hydraulic divide that separates the Yellowstone River drainage (to the east) from the Gallatin River drainage (to the west). The trail lies entirely within the Gallatin National Forest. \r\n\nAlthough much of the ridge is forested, there are plenty of breaks in the trees that afford impressive views in all directions. The northern horizon is dominated by Ramshorn Peak. To the west, the ridge drops off sharply into the Buffalo Horn Creek drainage. Further to the west the Madison Range is visible. To the east, above Tom Miner Creek and Sunlight Creek drainages the Absaroka Range can be seen. As the trail travels south it gradually rises 600 feet over 2 miles. Near the end, the trail tops out and affords great views down Dailey Creek to the south. \r\n\nThe trail continues along the ridge to 2 miles before ending at a junction with the Sky Rim Trail.
