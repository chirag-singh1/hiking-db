The parking area is well-kept with clear trail markers at the beginning point.  \r\n\nThe trail will split about a mile in - the west part of the loop is the easier portion of the trail overall, though the eastern portion offers its own beauty and the satisfaction of completing the more difficult route. As is typical with North Georgia trails, there will be muddy spots with any recent rain and many exposed roots, so make sure to have appropriate footwear.  Also beware of washed-out spots along the west approach to Lookoff. There is quite a bit of descending and ascending, so be ready for a challenge.

It begins on the west side of GA Hwy 157 and extends 3.4 miles to the Ascalon Road Trailhead.  Phase 1 (Long Branch) begins on the east side of GA Hwy 157 and extends to the Nickajack Road Trailhead and Phase 3 (Price Branch) begins across the street from the Ascalon Road Trailhead and will extend to the main portion of Cloudland Canyon State Park.\r\n\nThis 3.4-mile section of the CCT is a pleasant hike with only a few sections of steep grade.  Starting at the Ascalon Road Trailhead, you'll hike through some dense forest with a few gravel sections (for erosion control) before intersecting with the difficult South Hogsback Trail (on the right), which does not have a wooden sign marking it.  The CCT continues up a short, but somewhat steep climb towards the Caprock Trail (on the left).  After continuing slightly uphill for a few hundred feet, the CCT intersects with the Shale Flats Trail (on the right).\r\n\nThe next quarter mile is a fast, gently rolling, and wide singletrack that abruptly gives way to a steep climb to the Caprock Cut Through Trail (on the left) before returning to the fast, gently rolling singletrack for nearly a mile.  The CCT then intersects with the northern end of the Shale Flats Trail and continues on a gentle uphill towards the 5 Points Hub.  At the hub, a number of options exist on the left side of the CCT, while the Bankhead Trail (on the right) will take you to the Five Points Trailhead.\r\n\nThe CCT then continues gently along the grade with a few gentle climbs and descents to keep you entertained.  This section goes for nearly a mile without intersecting another trail, and is probably one of the fastest-paced, yet scenic, parts of the CCT.  The mature trees and foliage will almost make you feel as though you are at a higher elevation than 2,000 feet above sea level.  This pauses at the intersection with the Fugget Lift Trail (on the left) and the Peace Can Trail (on the right).\r\n\nContinuing past the Fugget Lift Trail / Peace Can Trail intersection, the CCT begins a relatively steep, sustained descent as it goes towards GA Hwy 157.  After the descent, the trail levels out a little bit but continues rolling gently and crosses a wooden bridge across a creek.  A couple of switchbacks are in place as the trail dips towards the creek.

Bikers should yield to those on foot. The trail hugs the shoreline in many locations, offering good wildlife viewing. You may see white-tailed deer, squirrels, rabbits, raccoons and turtles. It also travels into wooded uplands for different views of plants and trees. Although it looks like an easy jaunt around the lake, the distance can be deceiving. Be prepared for three to four hours of travel if doing the entire 7-mile loop.\r\n\n*This description assumes you're taking the trail clockwise around the lake.*\r\n\nAt the trailhead, there is a playground and paved \"beginner\" trail called the Bird Berry Trail which is a half mile round-trip, easy, short, paved trail featuring a birding area, nature signs and gazebo. About half way into the Bird Berry Trail, you exit the paved surface. After the trail crosses over a couple of \"roads\" the next major area you reach is the campgrounds so keep a watchful eye on the yellow blazes as they get confusing in this area. The yellow blazes go in both directions but the park mapped trail takes hikers LEFT and up the paved road to \"Yargo Camp Road\" where you make a RIGHT and follow the paved road down to the boat dock and camping area where you can pick up the yellow blazes again to make a LEFT and off the paved roadway.\r\n\nThe trip we took on this hike my wife pushed a B.O.B stroller with one kid and I packed the other on my back and we ran into little resistance, but there were some ups, downs, rocks, and roots that I did have to get the stroller over but it wasn't anything major or dangerous for the kids (1 year and 3 years old).\r\n\nThere are multiple bathroom stops along the route and it's well-traveled by other hikers and bikers.", "features": "Fall Colors \u00b7 Lake \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Swimming \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "All Clear"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7074805/still-water-from-the-dam", "ratings": {"rating": 4.1, "num_reviewers": 7}, "stats": {"dist": 6.7, "dist-type": "Loop", "alt-range": [986, 839], "alt-change": [751, 740], "avg-grade": 4.0, "max-grade": 20.0}},

Yargo State Park!  Visitors on foot are still welcome to use this trail, but must yield to mountain bikers, due to the purpose-built nature of the trail. However, keeping an eye and ear down the trail and stepping aside for the mountain bikers has never been a problem for me. The direction of travel for the mountain bikers changes, routing clockwise on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday, and switching to counter-clockwise on other days. I will typically hike in the opposite direction so I'm more aware to the mountain bikers and can quickly move out of the way.\r\n\nThe trailhead has immediate parking, and you start and finish right at your vehicle, which is a nice feature.  The first 3 or 4 miles are long and winding as you'll experience an, optional, water crossing, small wooden bridges, paved road, etc. The first highlight section of the trail is called *3-Step Hill* which follows old farming terraces and makes for a fun hike on the downhill and a three-step climb coming back up the hill.  There is a clearly marked bypass for this section.\r\n\nNext, you continue on around the campgrounds with views of the lake and wildlife. At this point, the trail is mostly downhill until you reach the dam at which point, you begin a 160-ft ascent over 2 miles which, optionally, includes a trip through the 1 mile section dubbed the *Monster Mile* which has short and steep climbs and descents. There is a clearly marked bypass for this section as well; however, it is NOT on this GPS route but it is marked with BLUE blazes, same as the rest of this trail. You'll continue down a gas pipeline clearing and to the southern tip of the lake.\r\n\nAs you continue on the trail, you cross over a steel bridge and head into a section called *Deadwood Hill* which has a lot of dead and dying trees, a result of either lightning or disease... It's really cool to see the impact on this area of the park, and it's a fun route with lots of turns. This part of the trail also brushes closer to the lake and makes for some great views.\r\n\nMoving down the trail, you come across the *Cemetery Hill* and *Horseshoe Drop* sections. The blue blazes are hard to follow in this area and there are some outdated markers along the route that are not on the map. Since I know this trail rides along the outside of the park, I followed the \"bypass\" arrows and always went left when I was unsure and was able to pickup the blue blazes after .5 miles or so. You can always use the Hiking Project mobile app to make sure you stay on track.\r\n\nYou wrap up your loop after *Heart Attack Hill* which leads you to the Lake Loop Trail until you arrive at the trailhead!", "features": "Fall Colors \u00b7 Lake \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Spring \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7074805/still-water-from-the-dam", "ratings": {"rating": 4.5, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 12.5, "dist-type": "Loop", "alt-range": [1012, 816], "alt-change": [2032, 2027], "avg-grade": 6.0, "max-grade": 22.0}},

It was built in 1977 through the efforts of the BMTA, the US Forest Service, and the Georgia Appalachian Trail Association. It is an attraction for the entire area and a frequent destination for local residents. Said to be the longest suspension bridge in Georgia, it is quite an engineering feat since the Toccoa River can have high and forceful floods. Look for some great overlooks from Toonowee (or \u201cTooni\u201d) Mountain as well.\r\n\nTrail Description: From Bryson Gap at mile 11.9 (WP 25, 2900\u2019), the trail heads a short distance down the NW side of the gap on an old lumber road, then shortly bears away from the road up the right bank. Be careful not to miss this turn or you may hike a long distance in the wrong direction until you discover the folly of your ways. This section of trail follows the west flank of Little John Dick Mountain then reaches a gap on the north flank of the mountain. From here the trail follows the ridgeline on a fairly level grade all the way to the ridge just above the Toccoa River suspension bridge. Just before the bridge at mile 14.5, the trail crosses gated FS 333 (WP 34). The bridge is at mile 14.7 (WP 35, 1920\u2019). At mile 14.9, a short side trail to the west takes you to a parking area at the end of FS 816 providing easy access to the area of the bridge. The trail climbs up over Toonowee Mountain (2720\u2019) and down the other side to GA 60 at mile 18.2 (WP 36, 2028\u2019) and the Little Skeenah Creek crossing\r\n\nCampsites: Camping is available at Bryson Gap (WP 25, 2900\u2019) and at a couple of small waterless LNT campsites along the ridgeline. The first is at mile 13.1 (WP 37), the second at mile 13.5 (WP 38). Several large campsites are available by the suspension bridge over the Toccoa River, large enough to accommodate a Scout troop. After passing the bridge, there are no campsites over Toonowee Mountain until you reach Little Skeenah Creek crossing at GA 60 at mile 18.2 (WP 36, 2028\u2019).\r\n\nWater Sources: Ample water is available at Bryson Gap (WP 25, A), the spring below the suspension bridge on the south side (A) and not much anywhere else. \r\n\nNote: Little Skeenah Creek and the Toccoa River have chicken farms upstream and water from this creek may not be good for drinking even if sterilized.

The woods on the south side of Wallalah Mountain are especially beautiful having an open feel with minimal underbrush and huge trees. Be forewarned, when hikers report that the BMT is tougher than the AT, they are probably referring to this section and/or to section 4. The Cherokee word for this area was \u201cSkeinah\u201d which meant ghost, devil or demon. If temped to hike both sections 3 and 4 in one day, keep in mind that it is an 11.6 mile hike with a total elevation gain of over 4000 feet. Allow plenty of  time and be sure to have adequate food and water as it is not an easy day hike. The easier direction to hike is N to S. \r\n\nTrail Description: The BMT leaves GA 60 at mile 18.2 (WP 36, 2028\u2019) and immediately crosses Little Skeenah Creek, a good-sized creek with dependable water all year, though it may be polluted from an upstream chicken farm. Camping is available close to the creek. From here you climb a series of steps, then level out about a half mile before beginning the tough climb up to the top of Wallalah. The switchbacks start at mile 19.3 and at mile 19.8 there is an overlook on top of a rocky outcrop with views to the south (WP 41). The top of Wallalah is at mile 20.1 (WP 42), where there is a primitive campsite but no water. Watch out for poison ivy up here. After leaving the top of the mountain, the trail switchbacks to the left, then again to the right and down to a gap at mile 20.9 before heading up to Licklog Mountain at mile 22.1 (WP 43, 3472\u2019). Several more switchbacks lead to a primitive campsite at the top. The trail turns sharp left, and then at mile 22.4 there is a nice campsite with water (WP 44). After leaving the campsite, the trail leads downhill then levels out to the intersection with the Duncan Ridge Trail which goes straight at mile 23.1 (WP 45). (See the BMT Thru-Hikers Guide by Ernest Engman for information on the Duncan Ridge Trail). Straight ahead on the Duncan Ridge Trail just 0.1 miles is a rocky bluff with great views off to the southwest. Turn left and descend Rhodes Mountain (3400\u2019).

For the next half mile the trail follows close to the ridge top on a fairly level track, then descends to Payne Gap at mile 26.6 (WP 48, 2650\u2019) crossing over an abandoned FS road. There is a campsite and a spring about 0.15 miles down the road to the right (north). After leaving Payne Gap, go up over a low ridge then down to mile 27.5 where you cross FS 640A/645 (WP 49).

Winter is also a good time to see great views of Lake Blue Ridge \r\n\nTrail Description: There is a large parking area at Wilscot Gap on GA Highway 60 at mile 29.8 (WP 39, 2450\u2019). This section starts across the road and 80 feet to the left of the forest service gate. Hikers head uphill and pass through a power line cut shortly after leaving the gap. The trail climbs  steadily uphill on old logging roads on the north side of Tipton Mountain. A spring will be seen in the ravine to the right of the trail at mile 30.7 (WP 54) and there is a short path leading down to it. The trail then switchbacks to the left and continues to ascend Tipton Mountain, reaching the top at mile 31.1 (3147\u2019) where there is a nice grassy flat campsite on the left and a spring on the right in the small gap between Tipton Mountain and Bald Top (WP 55, mile 31.8).

The trail parallels a gravel road for a short distance on the left side, then soon bears to the north away from the road. It goes around the foot of the ridge and travels generally uphill along the north side of Bear Den Mountain through a rhododendron thicket, a very pretty section of trail. The trail intersects with an old logging road and goes to the right where it soon crosses into a recently burned out section (spring 2010).  Sometimes the trail follows or crosses a fire break, at other times it leaves the fire break entirely making it necessary to watch the blazes closely so you don't lose the trail. It leaves the burned out area behind and continues to climb Bear Den Mountain. The trail levels out, then descends to Hudson Gap at mile 58.7 (WP 73, 2630'). It crosses the gravel road and heads uphill again, then goes up the south side of the ridge, and crosses the ridgeline. The trail then follows the north side of the ridge and recrosses the ridgeline where an old logging road comes in from the right. Follow the ridgeline to McKenny Gap at mile 60.2 (WP 68,  2730'). It is possible to camp in this gap but there is no water. The trail then continues along the south side of the ridge with a great viewpoint just before crossing once again over the ridge. The trail then heads down along a small creek on the right then enters Hatley Gap (WP 69, 2630'). Two great campsites are found here with water at a creek crossing about another 0.1 miles down the BMT from the gap.

Old GA 2 used to cross the mountains from Fort Oglethorpe to South Carolina through Dyer Gap. It fell into disuse and portions of it were closed when the area to the west was designated wilderness in the mid 1970s. A cemetery and open pavilion is still maintained at Dyer Gap. There are several very old headstones marking graves of settlers from the area. There are signs identifying Fowler Mtn, Flat Top Mtn,  Halloway Gap and Double Hogpen Gap\r\n\nTrail Description: From Fowler Mountain (WP 70, 3392\u2019) at mile 62.5, head north on the ridge line along Horse Ridge which peaks out at mile 63.7 (3542\u2019). After descending to Halloway Gap, at mile 64.5 (3230\u2019), a blue blazed trail goes down the east side of the gap for 0.1 miles to a nice spring and campsite built by the BMTA (WP 75).  From the gap, the trail climbs another ridge along the east side to a ridge top at Rackley School House Knob, then down to Double Hogpen Gap at mile 65.7 (3690\u2019). Just before the gap, at mile 65.6 there is a nice campsite along a small creek (WP 76). The actual gap is at mile 65.7 and features a large wildlife clearing which was Walker\u2019s Field from which the creek flows. This is the site of the Walker family homestead. No camping is allowed in the wildlife clearing. At mile 65.8, the trail turns left off an old logging road onto a singletrack. This can be a confusing turn since there is an intersection of three old logging roads and the trail itself. Watch closely for the left turn off the road. At mile 65.9 the trail again makes a sharp left turn but an old logging road goes straight. Take care again at this intersection. At mile 66.4 the trail begins crossing the four various headwater streams of the Jacks River. It then climbs to the top of Flat Top Mountain through a beautiful open hemlock forest, topping out a mile 67.2 at 3732\u2019. Flat Top Mountain is the highest point on the BMT in GA other than at Springer Mountain (3750\u2019) and was the site of  community of six or eight families who had a mill and a school here until 1918. From here it descends 850 feet on a trail which crosses FS 64 at mile 68.7. Dyer Gap is just a short 0.1 miles uphill to the right (WP 77, 2870\u2019) and the cemetery and open pavilion is just a little further up the road and can be seen from the gap.\r\n\nCampsites: There is a great campsite at Halloway Gap built by the BMTA at mile 64.5, just 0.1 miles down the east side of the gap near a stream (WP 75). Another excellent  campsite, with water is located at Double Hogpen Gap at mile 65.7 (WP 76). LNT camping is available on almost any relatively open flat spot but there are no other designated campsites. There are no reasonable campsites at the Jacks River headwater crossings.\r\n\nWater Sources: Water is available from the several headwater streams of the Jacks River around mile 66.4, the campsite at Double Hogpen Gap at mile 65.7 (WP 76, A) and at the campsite at Halloway Gap at mile 64.5 (WP 75, A).", "features": "Commonly Backpacked", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7061930/a-winter-beard", "ratings": {"rating": 4.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 6.3, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [3718, 2871], "alt-change": [958, 1473], "avg-grade": 7.0, "max-grade": 21.0}},

The Hemp Top Trail section, which the BMT follows for the most part, is a horse trail, so be cautious and yield to horse traffic. Hemp Top is the translation of the Cherokee word \u201cgatun-lti-yiy,\u201d which referred to the place where wild hemp grew. \r\n\nTrail Description: From the intersection with the Jacks River Trail at mile 76.0, the BMT heads north to Spanish Oak Gap at mile 77.3 (WP 88, 2930\u2019). At this point there is a closed FS road here which leads 1.0 miles down the east side of the ridge to the Dally Gap parking area (WP 87). This parking area is a major access point for backpackers and horsemen going over Big Frog on the Hemp Top Trail. The BMT continues north on an old roadbed which generally follows the ridgeline around a series of knobs toward Big Frog. The Penitentiary Trail intersects from the west at mile 78.8 at Rockwell Gap (WP 89). This 3.4 mile trail once led to a logging camp so remote that loggers named it \u201cThe Penitentiary.\u201d It also provides a side hike to the Jacks River Trail (and water). The BMT continues straight ahead. Just south of Hemp Top (WP 90, 3565\u2019) at mile 80.5, there is a sometimes confusing trail Y-intersection. The right fork leads to the top of Hemp Top to the site of a former fire tower. The left fork is the BMT. Follow along the west slope of Hemp Top on the BMT. The Double Spring Gap campsite on the TN/GA state line (WP 91, 3220\u2019) is at  mile 81.8.\r\n\nFrom this point, the trail ascends the steep slope of Big Frog Mountain. The Licklog Trail intersects from the right at mile 82.6 (WP 92), and the BMT bears left and continues a more gradual ascent up the remainder of Big Frog. An intermittent spring will be passed about 0.1 miles before reaching the crest of the mountain at mile 83.0. At the crest (WP 93, 4224\u2019), camping is available to the left (west) side of the trail. The Hemp Top Trail turns left at this point, but the BMT continues straight along the north slope of Big Frog. Since this is wilderness, there are no blazes and the wooden signs often are destroyed by bears or vandals.\r\n\nCampsites: There are two great campsites in this stretch, one at Double Spring Gap (WP 91, 3220\u2019) right on the TN/GA state line and another up on top of Big Frog Mountain (WP 93, 4224\u2019). There is room for several tents but water may be a problem in dry seasons.\r\n\nWater Sources: Water is scarce along this section of the BMT. Reliable water is available near the intersection with the Jacks River Trail (A), and a short way up the Jacks River Trail from the Dally Gap parking area (WP 87, C). At the Double Spring campsite (WP 91)water is available down both the east and west sides (west is best), but may dry up during drought seasons (A). Water is also intermittently available right along the BMT about 0.1 miles south of the Big Frog campsite (A).

Once across the swamp, you'll be back on singletrack for a short distance to an intersection, this is the start of the loop. The trail has a very different fill depending on which way you choose to go. If you prefer climbs on narrow singletrack, stay straight / right and this will lead you to EMT Hill. If you prefer an easier climb, turn left and follow Bear Creek downstream.  \r\n\nThe main highlight of the trail is Henry Mill Falls, however, there is much more to see along the trail and you'll soon forget you are only 15 minutes from the world's busiest airport. On the Big Ridge section of the trail, you'll be treated to great winter vistas from the top of the ridge, large rock outcrops and a fern-filled valley as you descend back to Bear Creek.  There is a short section of 2-way traffic as you continue downstream.  After a small creek crossing, you'll encounter a smaller loop. If you continue downstream, first you'll pass across the top of Henry Mill Falls before descending to an old Jeep road.  Follow the road uphill and look for the singletrack trail coming down from the right. This technical climb will lead to outstanding views above the creek.  Head back down the 2-way section then hook a left to wind back down the section of the Red Trail you haven't done yet. At 6.1 miles the trail intersects with the start of the loop.

You'll soon pass Cascade Falls as you continue climbing. \r\n\nAt about 0.9 miles into the trail, you'll take an abrupt left off the old roadbed and will cross the creek where you'll find some steps to negotiate on the other side of the creek. You'll then climb steeply for less than 100 yards, then follow the contour until you cross another creek. Another 0.1 of a mile or so, and you'll intersect with the Rhododendron Campground/Lake Connector Trail on your left.\r\n\nThe trail now climbs steeply, then takes a steep climbing turn to the right and continues to climb. After a turn to the left it gets even steeper for a hundred yards or so as it climbs through rhododendron and mountain laurel\u2013 I\u2019d estimate 20%+ grade.  \r\n\nFinally, the trail curls right again as the grade mellows and continues through lush foliage to the trail terminus at the top. You'll emerge to a paved road with large granite markers denoting the beginning of the trail. Climb the paved road to your left, and you'll encircle the top of Chenocetah Mountain.   \r\n\nYou'll be rewarded with a great view of Lake Russell and there is a historic fire tower at the very top of the mountain accessible by steps. The return trip down will be steep in some sections with limited sight lines in the mountain laurel.", "features": "Views", "condition": "Unknown"}, "ratings": {"rating": 3.5, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 1.8, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [1713, 1065], "alt-change": [648, 2], "avg-grade": 7.0, "max-grade": 37.0}},

After about 200 yards a road turns to the right into the group camp parking lot. Across the parking lot is the trail start shown as the green terminus on the map. Begin by crossing the small wooden bridge. Travel along the creek for a short way. The trail curls to the left at the stone stairs and begins a steep climb of approximately 0.5 to 0.75 mile. Once you crest the hill, you'll descend a short distance to a doubletrack - turn left.  \r\n\nGo down the doubletrack less than 0.25 mile and watch closely for the singletrack trail to the right - take this.

Hike across the wildlife opening to the road on the opposite side.\r\n\nOnce on the road you'll have a short descent and cross a creek. Just beyond the creek turn right on the dirt road and follow it for roughly a mile. Look closely to your left for the singletrack (signage vandalism is a problem here). Turn left and descend to a creek crossing. You'll then cross another creek and begin a steady climb culminating in a short, steep, rocky section. At the top of the climb, continue on the doubletrack to the right - the roadbed discussed earlier comes in from the left. Continue the gradual climb on the doubletrack until you reach a FS road. The trail continues as singletrack to your left parallel to the road. After 200 yards, the trail turns left up a steep doubletrack with several berms.

At the end of the connector, the trail begins at a gated bridge.  Hiking the trail clockwise, look for the trail to your left. The trail here begins as a singletrack. After about 100 yards the trail will cross a metal bridge over a creek and will continue to meander through a pine forest paralleling the creek for several hundred yards. The trail will then curve right to begin a very steep climb. The first portion of the climb is rutted, then curves to the right up through the pines.\r\n\nAfter a couple hundred yards of this steep climb the trail flattens for a short distance as you hike out of the pine canopy. Soon the trail climbs steeply, again up a rutted section of trail, for another 50 yards. At the top of the climb, the trail becomes more of a doubletrack and re-enters the pine forest. This section is rolling with no terribly steep grades. After about 0.25 mile of this you'll encounter a gravel FS road. The trail continues directly across the road.\r\n\nFrom the FS road, the trail makes a short climb then begins downhill. You have now transitioned into an area of hardwoods. The first corner is a 90-degree left that will sneak up on you. The trail winds downhill in a somewhat rutted segment. At the bottom of the hill, you'll take a hard left onto a single-railed wooden bridge. A short, steep climb and quick downhill will have you crossing a second small wooden bridge. Continue on this tight singletrack until you begin a steep downhill section.  At the bottom the trail goes hard right. A spur trail to the left takes you 100 yards to the Nancytown Falls - worth the short sidetrip.\r\n\nContinue on the trail and cross a very short footbridge. In about 20-30 yards there is a quick little downhill.  You'll then begin paralleling Nancytown Creek. The trail winds through a tight segment of mountain laurel as you continue along the creek. Next, cross the creek on another metal bridge (caution - the bridge leans and is slick when wet).  \r\n\nThe final segment of singletrack takes you through another pine stand and along a noisy section of the creek. Finally, the trail runs into another FS gravel road which is part of the trail - turn right on this road and immediately cross a bridge over the creek. Continue on this road.

This is a truly epic trail.  Within this section, one goes over four mountains, up and down long ridgelines, and over absolutely countless roots and rocks, almost all on singletrack.\r\n\nBeginning at the large trailhead parking lot with facilities at Ga Hwy 136, the trail immediately ascends Mill Creek Mt. and follows the ridgeline, crisscrossing the ridge later on until a right-hand curve and non-technical descent down the mountain to Swamp Creek which the trail then crosses a few times.  After this is a short section of doubletrack uphill, then a sharp left back onto singletrack and along the ridgeline of Middle Mt and eventually a subtle peak and another sharp right.  \r\n\nNext comes a technical, rocky descent to the Hurricane Mt ridgeline.  After the descent smooths out, there is a small side trail to Stover Creek, part of a favorite local loop, see the map for a full description of that loop.  The Pinhoti continues along the Hurricane Mt ridgeline another mile over some manageable rock gardens until hitting a steep descent into a saddle between Hurricane and Rocky Face (aka Dug) Mts, known as England Springs.  \r\n\nAt the low point, there's another side trail to the west that goes to Hurricane Creek where there is another access point.  The Pinhoti continues north up the mountain, literally up \"the wall\", a very steep and technical rocky section.  Once back on the ridgeline, from here to the end is almost one continuous rock garden as well as some gradual climbing to the highest point on the trail.  There is an overlook at Dug Gap.  At other locations along the various ridgelines, there are occasional peekaboo views, mostly of whichever ridge is next door.\r\n\nOverall this section of trail drains very well, like almost all of the Pinhoti, due to the nature of the rock and soil and you can hike it even when fairly wet with little issue.  As with much of the Pinhoti, this is multi-use trail also frequented by mountain bikers.

Then comes a one-mile descent on gravel service road, followed by nothing but singletrack until the end.  There is initially a hump over Pine Needle Hill, then a roll through the Pilcher's Pond area, then a high climb and descent over Horn Mountain with a hike along the ridgetop for part of it with wintertime views.

Taking a clockwise route will allow you to tackle the mountain ascent/descent first instead of last. \r\n\nStart by going down the small staircase (north side of Robert E. Lee Blvd.) and into the wooded area. You'll encounter some roots, rocks, and grading on your way to the mountain. Pay attention and slow down at some of the more difficult obstacles (it can get a bit tricky in some areas). Follow the signs and white blazes at the junctures. \r\n\nOnce you reach the base of the mountain, this is a good place to slow down and recover while ascending the backside of the mountain. Because of the grade, hiking at this juncture becomes a bit difficult. Some nice views can be had traveling up the mountain, so take a minute to enjoy. Once you reach the dirt vehicle road, hiking can commence with only minor obstacles to worry about. The descent isn't too difficult, but take your time, if needed. \r\n\nAt the bottom, you'll make a right (following the white blazes) and hike a fairly easy part of the trail through the woods. You'll eventually reach the park area and the trail will bring you inside this area, at which point you'll hike in front of the famous Stone Mountain carving. \r\n\nExiting the park area, you'll encounter very similar terrain until you reach and cross Robert E. Lee Blvd. At this point, you'll be hiking next to an aqueduct-type structure on the ground, and eventually reach the mill area. Take the sidewalk to the wooden bridge that hugs the mill and follow it. From here, the trail will follow the lake around; there's a portion where the trail turns into a stone path with no rails. You'll reach the covered bridge and associated small parking lot. The trail picks up on the other side of the lot (do not cross the bridge), and continues to follow the lake around under a wooded canopy. Along the way, you'll meet a few areas where you are once again on stone. \r\n\nTurn left at the orange/white trail juncture to bring you to the other side of the lake.

However, you'll probably still have to get you feet wet at the Shoal Creek ford.\r\n\nFrom the parking lot, travel east following red and blue blazes. You'll join the entrance road for a few hundred feet and then take the well-marked turn to the left through the field. \r\n\nThen you've got about one mile of easy forest road before taking a right up a difficult, rutted singletrack climb. You'll pass through a section of forest that was logged in winter 16/17. They've re-established the trail, and it is marked with red and blue ribbons. After the logged section, the trail returns to singletrack as it switchbacks its way down into a creek valley. The trail then parallels the creek climbing gently for about one mile. This segment ends at a forest road (Powerline Road). \r\n\nTurn right and then left at the T-intersection with Shoal Creek (forest) Road, always following the blue blazes and signs. Descend one mile on Shoal Creek Road. It should be possible to hike across the Shoal Creek at this point even after a heavy rain, but you may find water halfway up your calves. After fording Shoal Creek, climb Shoal Creek Road for about 1/2 mile and then there is a singletrack entrance on your left.\r\n\nThe next 1.5 miles are typical North Georgia singletrack, gently undulating through the forest with lots of roots, the occasional fallen tree, and a number of shorter creek crossings. After a steep climb, you'll turn left onto North Gate (forest) Road.\r\n\nAfter about 1/10th mile on North Gate Road, look for singletrack on the right. This begins a fun mile of singletrack high up on a ridge after which you'll enjoy a quick 200 ft descent down to the Etowah River. Then the trail follows the river for a mile until you reach a trail junction. Here you have the option to ford the river to continue on the Blue Trail (South), to travel north on the Yellow Trail (North Gate Road) back to the Blue Trail (North), or to turn around and backtrack the way you've come.", "features": "River/Creek", "condition": "All Clear"}, "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 9.0, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [1269, 1031], "alt-change": [712, 760], "avg-grade": 3.0, "max-grade": 17.0}},

The historic 175 feet-long Shallowford Bridge was built in 1918 in the classic \u201cPratt through truss\u201d design popular at that time. It is eligible for inclusion in the National Registry of Historic Places.   There is a small convenience store and restaurant near the junction of Shallowford Bridge Road with Aska Road (Toccoa Wilderness Outpost).   \r\n\nTrail Description: The trail begins at the intersection of Old Dial Road and Shallowford Bridge Road at mile 35.6 (WP 53, 1881\u2019). On the northwest corner of the intersection, the trail climbs steadily uphill to a ridgeline generally traveling west just to the north of Shallowford Bridge Road. The trail has several short steep sections, mostly keeping to the crest of the ridge (maximum elevation 2140\u2019). There is a nice campsite, albeit without water, about a quarter of a mile up the trail in a small gap. At mile 36.3 the trail begins to slowly descend to the Toccoa River on an old logging road, reaching the river and Shallowford Bridge Road at mile 36.9 (WP 58, 1800\u2019). Turn right and follow the road to the Shallowford Bridge at mile 37.4. Cross the bridge to the intersection with Aska Road (WP 59). The remainder of this section is a road walk on Aska and Stanley Creek Roads. Turn right (southwest) onto Aska Road and then turn left onto Stanley Creek Road at mile 37.7. At mile 40.8, leave the road and turn right onto a trail which follows Fall Branch (WP 60, 2000\u2019).\r\n\nNote: A nice day hike is to hike from Wilscot Gap to Shallowford Bridge, a distance of 7.1 miles, combining parts of the maps on page 30 and 32.\r\n\nCampsites: Primitive camping without water is available at mile 35.9 (WP 61) on a ridgeline in a gap. No other established campsites are available along this section, though one could camp near where the trail leaves Stanley Creek Road after crossing Fall Branch (WP 60).\r\n\nWater Sources: Water is available from a few seasonal runoffs along the edge of Shallowford Bridge Road (A).

Shortly after crossing Laurel Creek, turn left and follow this old road through two gates and on out to GA 5/515. The BMTA has permission to cross the private property between the two closed gates, but hikers must not leave the road bed or camp here. Use care in crossing the busy four-lane, divided highway. After doing so, go a short distance south to the trailhead on the west side of the highway at mile 49.7 (WP 62, 1590'). Then immediately turn left along the edge of the fence, passing through it  beside a BMT sign. \r\n\nThe Trail then follows a switchback up the hill to the backside of the Craddock Center and heads down the ridge to an unpaved road. Free parking is available in the parking lot of the Craddock Center and is much safer than parking down on GA 515. The Craddock Center has a marked driveway off GA 515 just north of Joann Sisson Road.\r\n\nAfter crossing the creek again it  turns left onto Mountain View Road at mile 50.4. It makes another left turn onto JoAnn Sisson Rd, then a right turn onto Bill's Place where is passes  a house and goes into the woods on an unimproved primitive road. Follow this track to the Cherry Lake Dam (mile 51.0), the Recreation Chapel (WP 64) and to a series of wooden stairways up to the road. At the road, turn left again, then right onto Indian Rock Road. \r\n\nThe Trail bears right off the side of the road, then crosses a creek, then comes to the Sisson Shelter (WP 65, mile 51.3). This is the only BMT Shelter south of the Smokies and is a great place to spend a night next to a nice creek. The trail then rejoins Indian Rock Road, goes past a pond with a picnic area, and  through another covered bridge. It passes an unusual rock outcropping on the left (Indian Rock). Upon reaching the driveway for #297, the Trail goes straight up the driveway then back into the woods where the driveway curves right. JT's Trail goes left at mile 51.8. The BMT proceeds straight up the ridge, meeting a road at mile 52.1. It crosses the road, then meets another road at mile 52.5. At this road it turns right, and leaves the road again shortly, again to the right. \r\n\nFollow this trail up over a ridgeline (2264') then down the backside of the ridge to Boardtown Road at mile 53.5 (WP 66, 1780'). The Trail turns left onto Boardtown Road and follows the road for about a mile to the intersection with Bushy Head Gap Road. It  then turns right onto Bushy Head Gap Road (mile 54.4) and follows this road to the Bushy Head Gap at mile 56.1 (WP 67, 2090'). \r\n\nCampsites: The Sisson Shelter is on the Sisson Property at mile 51.3 (WP 65). This shelter will hold about six people. There is a creek and a fire ring in front of the shelter.\r\n\nWater Sources: Water is available from several creeks in the Sisson Property (D).

The historic 175 feet-long Shallowford Bridge was built in 1918 in the classic \u201cPratt through truss\u201d design popular at that time. It is eligible for inclusion in the National Registry of Historic Places. There is a small convenience store and restaurant near the junction of Shallowford Bridge Road with Aska Road (Toccoa Wilderness Outpost).   \r\n\nTrail Description: The trail begins at the intersection of Old Dial Road and Shallowford Bridge Road at mile 35.6 (WP 53, 1881\u2019). On the northwest corner of the intersection, the trail climbs steadily uphill to a ridgeline generally traveling west just to the north of Shallowford Bridge Road. The trail has several short steep sections, mostly keeping to the crest of the ridge (maximum elevation 2140\u2019). There is a nice campsite, albeit without water, about a quarter of a mile up the trail in a small gap. At mile 36.3 the trail begins to slowly descend to the Toccoa River on an old logging road, reaching the river and Shallowford Bridge Road at mile 36.9 (WP 58, 1800\u2019). Turn right and follow the road to the Shallowford Bridge at mile 37.4. Cross the bridge to the intersection with Aska Road (WP 59). The remainder of this section is a road hike on Aska and Stanley Creek Roads. Turn right (southwest) onto Aska Road and then turn left onto Stanley Creek Road at mile 37.7. At mile 40.8, leave the road and turn right onto a trail which follows Fall Branch (WP 60, 2000\u2019).\r\n\nNote: A nice day hike is to hike from Wilscot Gap to Shallowford Bridge, a distance of 7.1 miles.\r\n\nCampsites: Primitive camping without water is available at mile 35.9 (WP 61) on a ridgeline in a gap. No other established campsites are available along this section, though one could camp near where the trail leaves Stanley Creek Road after crossing Fall Branch (WP 60).\r\n\nWater Sources: Water is available from a few seasonal runoffs along the edge of Shallowford Bridge Road (A). Also, potable water and food as well as some supplies are available at the store and restaurant at the intersection of Aska Road and Shallowford Bridge Road (Toccoa Wilderness Outpost). Water is available as well from Stanley Creek (D) and Fall Branch (WP 60, A).

It's best to park near the game check station off Stamp Creek Road and then take Grassy Hollow Road to the bridge over Stamp Creek where there is a natural swimming hole. Nearby the creek, there's an impressive old iron furnace. Pine Log Gap Road then continues north.\r\n\nSupposedly there's an old saw mill nearby as well, but you'll need better luck than I had to find it. If you really want a challenge from this point, follow Grassy Hollow Road back around to your car.\r\n\nContinuing on Pine Log Gap Road, the road becomes a little rougher, but never very difficult. At four miles, you have a bit of a climb to contend with. After that, the road becomes a little more rustic and less smooth with larger rocks.\r\n\nAs you start to work your way down from the top of the climb, you'll pass through an area of several iron mines which are evident by the disturbed topography in the area and part of the road follows an old railbed. Spoiler alert: the mines aren't that interesting though.\r\n\nOn the way down, there are a couple of ponds (created by the mining activities) and Sugar Hill Creek off to your left. You do have to ford this creek at 7.5 miles and then after a short distance you'll reach Neel Lake. Shortly thereafter, the forest road ends at the north end of the WMA on East Valley Road. You can either turn around or take East Valley Road to US-411 to Stamp Creek Road back to the beginning.\r\n\nSome of the road is lacking in shade and can feel quite hot on a typical Georgia summer day, but the area that passes through the former mine passes through a narrow cut with good shade cover.\r\n\nUnfortunately, it takes a PhD to understand when you can hike and how much it will cost.

Presumably these were placed to keep out vehicles as the trail follows an old road bed, although this has now essentially become a narrow singletrack. Keep an eye out, as you wouldn't want to trip!\r\n\nAside from the creek crossings, the character of the trail is similar to the others in the area: expect lots of root obstacles as you pass beneath dense foliage. Around the two-mile mark, there is a section of trail that descends steeply, is particularly narrow, filled with rocks, with potentially a couple-foot drop down into the creek. However, overall the trail isn't any more technically demanding than any of the other trails in the area. But because the trail is a bit more remote, the consequences of a fall could be greater.\r\n\nBecause this trail doesn't get as much traffic, you're more likely to encounter downed trees and potentially overgrown vegetation. This is particularly true south of the intersection with the Pinhoti Trail at 2.8 miles. Note the trail descends more gradually after this intersection as well.\r\n\nI will say that Mountaintown Creek is best done as a group hike given the remoteness and because you can let some other poor soul take the lead so they clear out all the spider webs. If it hasn't been traveled in a while, you might find yourself stopping to remove an entire spider web from your face every couple hundred feet.", "features": "Fall Colors \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7062348/waterfall-along-mountain-creek", "ratings": {"rating": 5.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 5.8, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [3164, 1690], "alt-change": [151, 1612], "avg-grade": 6.0, "max-grade": 29.0}},

The Pinhoti is the longest trail in Alabama and spans 355 miles from the Talladega National Forest to its intersection with the BMT. At mile 74.1 the trail enters the Cohutta Wilderness, the largest wilderness in the East. Even though this section is marked MS due to the total elevation gain, the trail has several short stretches of mild ups and downs and is fairly easy to navigate.\r\n\nTrail Description: From Dyer Gap at mile 68.8 (WP 77, 2870\u2019), turn west on FS 64 and go 0.1 miles to where the BMT exits downhill off the right side of the road. At mile 69.4 (WP 78, 2630\u2019), the trail intersects the South Fork Trail. There is a good campsite just before the intersection and water is available on the other side of the trail (WP 78). At mile 70.2 and 70.9 there are two nice campsites along the South Fork. At mile 71.0 (WP 79), the trail intersects with the Pinhoti Trail, which continues to follow the creek to the left. From the Pinhoti Trail intersection, go uphill to the right on an old fire road. At mile 70.7 the trail turns left onto another old fire road. At mile 71.9 this fire road crosses a small creek. The trail leaves this fire road at mile 72.6 and crosses an unnamed knob at mile 73.0 (2960\u2019) before heading downhill to Watson Gap and FS 64 at mile 73.3 (WP 80, 2700\u2019). From Watson Gap, the trail goes up FS 22 (signed \u201cDally Gap 3 miles\u201d). It leaves FS 22 sharply uphill to the left at mile 73.8 (WP 81), tops over a gap at mile 73.9, then goes down the other side. The trail crosses Mill Branch on a small footbridge at mile 74.8 (WP 86, 2660\u2019). The Joe Watkins place was here until 1950, one of the last occupied homesteads in the area. The trail heads uphill to cross a gap (2930\u2019). The BMT enters the Cohutta Wilderness at this point, then descends to cross Peter Cove Branch at mile 75.3. It crosses Bear Branch at mile 75.6 where a campsite is available (WP 84), then ascends a low hill. Old growth trees, especially huge hemlocks can be seen along this section. At mile 75.9 the BMT intersects the Jacks River Trail. It turns right and continues for one tenth before turning left and going uphill. If you go straight ahead on the Jacks River Trail, the trail is a gentle 0.9 miles uphill to the Dally Gap Parking Lot (WP 87). There is a big spring on the right side of the JRT just a short distance east from its intersection with the BMT.\r\n\nCampsites: Several good campsites are available along this section of the trail. The first is at the junction with the South Fork Trail at mile 69.4 (WP 78). There are two other good campsites along the South Fork at mile 70.2 (WP 82) and 7092 (WP 83). The next campsite is at Bear Branch, mile 75.6 (WP 84). Remember, LNT ethics encourages backpackers to not camp right on the edge of a creek.\r\n\nWater Sources: Water is available many places along this section of the trail and should be no problem to the hiker or backpacker. Water is available several points along the South Fork, at mile 71.9 (WP 85, C) along the old fire road, mile 74.1 where the BMT crosses Mill Branch (WP 86, C) and mile 75.6 where it crosses Bear Branch (WP 84, C). Water is also available a short distance east up the Jacks River Trail from the intersection with the BMT at mile 75.9 (A).", "features": "Commonly Backpacked \u00b7 River/Creek", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7078575/great-camping-spot-by-the-creek-with-fire-ring", "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 6.8, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [2892, 2492], "alt-change": [791, 1105], "avg-grade": 5.0, "max-grade": 19.0}},

The trail is beneath a hardwood forest canopy with a fair amount of rhododendron, so you can count on some good shade on a hot summer day. This is a popular route, so don't expect a solitary experience.\r\n\nStraight off the bat from the parking lot behind the pit toilet, there is a great view to the south of a couple of bald mountains. At the end of a short (~0.1 mi) boardwalk section, there is an accessible overlook that has a view of the falls. \r\n\nThe trail can be divided roughly into thirds between two major hairpin bends.\r\n\nThe first third is actually probably the steepest and most difficult with a few roots in the trail to avoid and some stairs. The first third takes you down to Dukes Creek. If you turn right at the bottom of the trail, there is a trail that leads right down to the creek. If you cross it and turn left up the road, you can easily continue over to the Raven Cliff Falls hike. Turn left to continue towards Dukes Creek Falls.\r\n\nAfter the first hairpin, the second third of the trail joins an old roadbed. Here the trail is several feet wide with a nice gravel base and the trail is more level. This part of the trail parallels Dukes Creek for a quarter mile or so. There are a number of cascades and one small waterfall that would make this an enjoyable outing even if there weren't the two larger waterfalls at the end.\r\n\nAt the second hairpin turn, you'll reach a sign that points you in the direction of the waterfall. Continuing straight at this point takes you into Smithgall Woods State Park via the Dukes Creek Falls Access Trail, but you'll need a permit from the park for this. Instead take a sharp right to continue towards the waterfall. You'll leave the old roadbed for a more rustic trail. It is similar in character to the first third with the occasional rooty section and a few rocks to step over.

At the north end there is a small parking area at the Narrows picnic area.  As a multi-use trail, it's used by day-hikers, through-hikers, mountain bikers, and equestrians, and collectively maintained by NWGA SORBA, the GPTA, and the BCHNWGA.

Then the trail meets and joins a forest service road for about 2.4 miles, the first part of which is standard forest service road fare, the second half has a little more abandoned road feel to it.  There is about a half-mile down and a half-mile up from a hollow in the ridge, where there is a minor stream crossing.  \r\n\nAfter the climb back out from this, there is about a mile of more abandoned dirt road, then a return to true singletrack.  This goes on for about 2 miles gradual uphill, the second mile of which is along the crest of the ridge itself, with nice views of the valley to either side during winter.  After hitting the highest point at about mile 7, there is a descent down about 3/4 mile to old gravel road, which goes for about 1/4 mile, then hits another gravel road and turns right.

From its southern terminus at Springer Mtn, the A.T. descends at times to low valleys, crossing several streams, but mostly follows ridges at \r\nelevations around 3000 feet and rises at times to summits over 4000 feet.\r\n\nOutstanding peaks along the A.T. include Springer Mtn, Big Cedar Mtn, Blood Mtn, Cowrock Mtn, Rocky Mtn, Tray Mtn, and Kelly Knob. The trail crosses major highways at Woody Gap, Neels Gap, Tesnatee Gap, Hogpen Gap, Unicoi Gap, and Dicks Creek Gap.\r\n\nThe Georgia A.T. is almost etirely in the Chattahoochee National Forest.  It borders or passes through eight counties: Gilmer; Fannin; Union; Lumpkin; Towns; White; Habersham; and Rabun; and four Ranger Districts: Toccoa, Chattooga, Brasstown, and Tallulah. Approximately 40 miles of the Georgia A.T. is within Congressionally designated Wilderness areas: Blood Mtn Wilderness, Raven Cliffs Wilderness, Mark Trail Wilderness, Tray Mtn Wilderness, and Southern Nantahala Wilderness.

The commemorative and informational plaques at the start of the AT are a favorite photo opportunity for hikers as is the Springer Mountain AT Shelter which is close by. A short distance down the BMT is a plaque commemorating Benton MacKaye, the founder of the AT. Owen's Vista at mile 1.4 is worth a trip in its own right with its sweeping views of the surrounding mountains. With the four AT/BMT junctions in this 6-mile section, it is possible to make several fairly short circuit hikes starting from the Springer Mountain Access Parking Area off FS 42 or from Three Forks on FS 58.\r\n\nTrail Description: The AT begins at Springer Mountain (WP 8, 3782') and the BMT begins 0.2 miles up the AT (WP 9, 3750') a short distance past the trail to the Springer Mountain Shelter. The Benton MacKaye plaque (WP 10) is 0.1 miles down the BMT on the right mounted on a rock slab and it provides another good photo opportunity. The trail goes downhill to the short side trail to Owen's Vista at mile 1.3 (WP 11). This is a great lunch spot with views of the surrounding mountains. The BMT crosses FS 42 at mile 1.7 (WP 7), then heads downhill to a dry gully, up over a small ridge, then down to a stream crossing. There is a nice campsite at mile 2.2 just after crossing the stream on the right (WP 12). There are two more creek crossings at mile 2.6 and 2.7. At mile 3.2 the BMT crosses the AT (WP 13) on a ridgeline. The trail then goes downhill to a right-hand turn at mile 3.4, then heads back up over a ridge to again cross the AT at mile 3.9 (WP 14) on Rich Mountain. The Stover Creek AT Shelter is 0.8 miles down the AT west from this intersection. The BMT goes straight across the AT and follows the top of Rich Mountain (3357') on a fairly level trail for the next mile or so, then heads down the west side of the ridge to its last intersection with the AT at mile 5.9 just south of Three Forks (WP 15). Turn right on the AT and go a short distance to a bridge over the creek and FS 58, where there is parking and camping (WP 16, 2550'). This is mile 6.0.\r\n\nCampsites: The Springer Mountain AT Shelter (WP 17) has a lean to, water, and a bear cable. There is another campsite is at mile 2.2 just after you cross a small branch (WP 12). The Stover Creek AT Shelter is 0.8 miles west on the AT from the AT/BMT crossing at mile 3.9 with a lean to, water, and a bear cable. Camping is permitted at Three Forks on the south side of the creek before crossing the footbridge (WP 16).\r\n\nWater Sources: Water is available at the Springer Mountain Shelter (A), at the campsite at mile 2.2 (WP 12, B), at a creek crossing at mile 2.6 (WP 18, B) and again at mile 2.7 (B). Water is available down the AT from the BMT/AT intersection of mile 3.9 west at the Stover Creek Shelter 0.8 miles (A) or east at a creek crossing 0.9 miles (A).

The falls is on a side trail at the junction of the BMT and the AT. Also at the Long Creek Falls Trail junction, the Duncan Ridge Trail starts and follows the BMT for 16.8 miles until it leaves the BMT on Rhodes Mountain (page 20). The \u201cBald\u201d at mile 8.1 is a grassy field with far-reaching views. Bryson Gap at mile 11.9 is a great place for a large group to camp. \r\n\nTrail Description: From FS 58 at Three Forks at mile 6.0 (WP 16), head north on the BMT/AT up the valley of Long Creek, which flows along the west side of the trail. At mile 6.6 there is a short side trail down to a 30 foot water fall. At mile 6.9 (WP 21) the AT diverges to the right from the BMT. Also at this intersection is a side trail down to Long Creek Falls (WP 22), about 50 feet high. At mile 7.1 there is a sharp left turn and two bridge crossings over the Long Creek drainage. The trail heads steeply uphill at mile 7.6 to crest at an unnamed bald at mile 8.1 (WP 23 ,3250\u2019). This is a large open field with outstanding views of the surrounding mountains. From this point, the trail heads downhill to No Name Gap (aka Owens Gap, WP 24, 3020\u2019) at mile 8.6, then climbs steeply uphill, leveling out at about 3200 feet elevation. Wildcat Ridge is located at mile 10.6 and from here the trail goes along the east shoulder of Big John Dick Mountain, then circles around to the northeast side of the mountain before switchbacking down to Bryson Gap at mile 11.9 (WP 25, 2900\u2019). There is a large camping area at Bryson Gap with a water source of each side of the gap.\r\n\nCampsites: LNT ethics suggest to not camp right next to a creek. Camping is available at Three Forks (see page 15). There are several LNC campsites along the trail to Bryson Gap. The first is right along Long Creek at mile 6.3 (WP 26). There are two nice roomy campsites down the trail to Long Creek Falls at mile 6.9. The first is just a short distance from the trail intersection and the second (WP 27) is down by the falls 0.1 miles from the BMT/AT intersection. Just past the bridge over Long Creek at mile 7.1 there is a small campsite accessible by a side trail along the edge of a tributary of Long Creek (WP 28). At mile 7.6 just before the trail leaves the creek there is a small campsite.", "features": "Commonly Backpacked \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Waterfall", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7075572/long-creek-falls-from-bottom-of-falls", "ratings": {"rating": 4.5, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 5.8, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [3243, 2584], "alt-change": [1149, 809], "avg-grade": 6.0, "max-grade": 24.0}},
