Cars must park in a small parking lot on the the opposite side of the fields as the guard station. It is then a short hike, along the paved road, to the beginning of the trail. Horse trailers may park in the grass field opposite the basketball courts at the start of the trail. \r\n\nThis loop trail (red) begins as a lackluster gravel road, then curving to the right, back to a clearing in the woods where the property manager cuts and stores wood. Before entering this clearing, you'll see a small path, to the left, on which you'll exit the loop. Entering the clearing, you may start to wonder \"how the heck was this trail rated 4 stars?\" or \"am I allowed to be here?\" Hiking through the wood storage area, the road gives way to a trail. Scenes of the human-designed world quickly slip away, replaced with the gravity of serene wilderness as you immediately start a descent into the Patapsco River Valley. The established canopy provides shade for the remainder of the loop, until you return to the beginning. \r\n\nThe trail can make hiking not only manageable, but enjoyable on even a 90-degree day. You may hear gunshots from the nearby Associated Gun Clubs of Baltimore, Patapsco Range, but even this reminder of the outside world disappears as you continue down toward the river. As the trail flattens, you can see the Patapsco River peeking through the trees. Here, the Switchback Trail (white) enters from the right and joins the Plantation Trail as you turn left. There is a foot path that has been carved out leading to the river. The water is not deep here, and runs over a variety of different sized rocks and boulders, making for an enjoyable pause and relaxation, or play spot. \r\n\nAs the trail parallels the river, it is flat and easy, perhaps a bit muddy in some spots during certain seasons. It is not long before the inevitable happens...you came down, so you knew, at some point, you would have to go back up! The Plantation Trail (red) turns left, up the hill, and the Switchback Trail (white) continues on. The initial ascent is steep, then the trail eases a bit. The ending includes another steep section before the grade slowly equalizes, and you exit the loop. Deer, squirrel, and a variety of birds are common along the trail.

Note that the Park HQ is not the same building or location as the Catoctin Mountain Park Visitor Center. The visitor center is one mile away from the HQ on Route 77.  \r\n\nThe trailhead is well marked and is easy locate with a sign for Cat Rock and Overlook (1.25 miles). It is a yellow-blazed trail, and although blazes are present on the trail, sometimes they are faded and not well maintained. The trail is wide enough for 2 people to hike side by side, and the trail initially parallels Route 77 as it ascends away from the parking area. About .4 miles into the hike, you'll pass a huge uprooted tree, and as the trail continues up, you'll cross multiple water bars. At .8 miles into the trail, you'll cross a ravine/gully. After a strong storm it will be flowing; however, this is not a reliable water source. \r\n\nAs the trail continues uphill, it will cross under a large set of power lines. Shortly after crossing the power lines, approximately 1 mile into the hike, the trail turns left along the edge of the mountain, continuing upwards on the mountain top/ridge. Once on the ridge, the trail flattens out, and at 1.1 miles into the hike, the trail intersects with with Cat Rock Overlook Spur. The Cat Rock Trail continues to the right towards Bob Hill. This intersection is well marked. Continue straight to scramble up onto Cat Rock with a great view of the mountains. \r\n\nGetting on top of Cat Rock requires some scrambling and mindful placement of hands a feet. Be careful as there are plenty of opportunities for falls, injuries, and rolled ankles. This view is wonderful and since the trail is significantly less traveled then the Wolf Rock / Chimney Rock Trail there is good chance you'll have the rock to yourself while you are there. \r\n\nAfter you are done enjoying the view, backtrack to the Cat Rock Trail and follow the signage to the right towards Bob Hill. The trail will turn to the right and go uphill for a bit with a few switchbacks before eventually leveling out along the ridge. This section of the trail is not well blazed, but the trail is well traveled so you should be able to stay on the trail.  The yellow blazes do pick up again just keep an eye out for them. The Cat Rock Trail terminates at the Catoctin National Scenic Trail. There is a 4x4 sign marker, and it is well placed.

From here, there's a few more creek crossings, more roots than the first half, and a few short climbs. I would recommend branching off at the Creekside Cliff Trail (which is yellow blazed) for a nice little area along the creek. \r\n\nIf you stay on the South Tuckahoe Valley Trail it will eventually open up between tall thin trees and a crushed stone double wide path.
