If you're interested in getting your hands on some paper maps, a set of six maps that cover the entire Superior Hiking Trail is available for $5.00 and the Guide to the Superior Hiking Trail is $15.95. Find them here.\r\n\nThe SHT follows the ridgeline overlooking Lake Superior for most of its length. Hikers will enjoy views of the Great Lake Superior from the ridge of the ancient Sawtooth Mountains as well as babbling brooks, rushing waterfalls, and abundant wildlife. \r\n\nThe lowest point in the path is 602 feet above sea level and the highest point is 1,829 feet above sea level.  Intended for pedestrian use only. Motorized vehicles, mountain bikes, and horses are not allowed on the trail. \r\n\nThe trail sees users of all varieties from day-use, weekenders, to full on end-to-end through-hikers.  Overnight and longer users will find the 92 backcountry, fee-free campsites perfectly spaced along the trails length to allow for a day's hiking whether you're a five-mile-a-day or a 20 mile-a-day type.\r\n\nThe Duluth section of the trail comprises 41 miles and starts southwest of the city of Duluth at a trailhead in Jay Cooke State Park. The trail extends to the northeast through the Spirit Mountain Recreation Area, Brewer Park, Enger Park, the Historic Downtown Area, Canal Park, the Lakewalk, and Hartley Nature Center,[6] before it ends at a trailhead located on Martin Road on the north side of the city. The Duluth section provides opportunities for day-use.\r\n\nThe North Shore section of the trail is 255 continuous miles and begins at the Martin Road Trailhead on the northern boundary of the City of Duluth. From there, the trail extends to the northeast along Lake Superior through seven state parks, including Gooseberry Falls State Park, Split Rock Lighthouse State Park and Tettegouche State Park. This section of the SHT passes near the towns of Lutsen and Grand Marais, and ends just before the Canada  United States border. The North Shore section provides backcountry experiences and is utilized by both short hikers and backpackers.  A through hike of the Superior Hiking Trail typically spans this 255-mile section. The total elevation gain along the North Shore section is 37,800 feet and the elevation loss is 37,400 feet for a northbound hiker.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 Lake \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Swimming \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Waterfall \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7004682/cascade-falls", "ratings": {"rating": 4.9, "num_reviewers": 42}, "stats": {"dist": 299.8, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [1798, 603], "alt-change": [31233, 30542], "avg-grade": 4.0, "max-grade": 58.0}},

Since the trail parallels the ridge itself (Hawk Ridge - the trail's namesake), there isn't a lot of sustained climbing or descent....just undulation. \r\n\nThe rattle-factor of this trail makes it tough to classify as \"easy\". It's probably most accurately described as \"intermediate\". Note that if this trail proves a bit too much of a beginner, there are ample opportunities to \"opt-out\" by cutting just a few feet, uphill, through the woods to hike the gravel road just above (Skyline Pkwy). \r\n\nThe views to the southeast are stunning and relentless. You're never more than a few seconds away from a good place to 'pull over' and take in the views of Lake Superior and the City of Duluth below. It wouldn't be uncommon to see a ship or two coming or going from the harbor, and the cluster of sailboats ducking it out in one of the Duluth Yacht Club's week night races.

Cross a couple of XC ski trails before you've made it far enough west to catch your first few glimpses of Amity Creek through the woods. Once the trail reaches the Amity Creek ravine, it follows this ravine (on the east side) upstream, rolling along all the way.\r\n\nYou get some great views of Gazebo Falls on Amity Creek as you hike through beautiful tall pines. After the falls, you'll cross the snowmobile trail and skirt along Seven Bridges Road for a bit. \r\n\nNot much further and you'll find yourself at a spider intersection in the pines. You can opt to go left/west across Seven Bridges Road and onto Amity West Trail, or continue on Amity East by keeping to the right.\r\n\nIn the next section, you'll be mostly climbing, but there are plenty of short descents scattered along this segment as it rolls up the hill.\r\n\nThis section gets relatively rocky/rooty, especially nearest the northern end. There aren't however, any prolonged technical sections. Just one or two rocky spots.\r\n\nWhen you get the chance to safely do so, don't forget to look down and take in the views of the Amity Creek ravine as you go.\r\n\nThe top terminus of Amity East is at it's intersection with the Lester River Trail - Duluth Traverse.

Occasionally, the singletrack will briefly connect up with a doubletrack trail when it needs to cross culverts and streams. Eventually, you'll come to an intersection where the trail splits into three. There's doubletrack on the left that leads uphill to a residential area. There's singletrack to the right that continues to hug the river bank.  To continue on this trail, take the middle singletrack.\r\n\nFrom 11th Ave S., enter the trail at the SW corner of the school field. Descend the wide, crushed rock doubletrack. As the trail crosses a stream, look for the singletrack to start on your right.  \r\n\nHere, the Minnesota River Bottoms trail gets more interesting. It changes character from flat and rolling by the river bank to hillier with small to medium climbs as the trail hugs the valley bluff.  Off shoot trails branch off to the left and generally lead to access points on top of the bluffs.  Keep to the right to continue on the trail.  \r\n\nEventually, you'll come across an old park. They've recently reseeded grass in the area where there used to be a parking lot. There are still old picnic tables and fire pits in the woods.

It came into being in 1976 thanks to the efforts of local volunteers, land owners, and county officials. This park preserves remnants of the Big Woods ecosystem from lush lowlands to tree covered uplands. The Cannon River itself is one of six designated Wild and Scenic Rivers in Minnesota.\r\n\nThere are two trailheads in the park. The East Trailhead accesses a 1.2 mile trail to the river. The West Trailhead accesses two linked loops which are the longest trails in the park.\r\n\nFrom the West Trailhead, the trail goes past a footbridge over the river. This bridge leads to the only campsite on the east side of the river. Shortly thereafter, the trail splits at the first loop. Go right (east) here to continue on along the river and under some powerlines to the start of the second loop. Go right (east) again here to continue on along the river. NOTE: Parts of the second loop may not be mowed.\r\n\nAbout 2 miles from the trailhead, the second loop will bend inland from the river. Pay attention in here as the left turn (to the southwest) that puts you on the old (possibly unmowed) road back to the trailhead may be obscured by vegetation.

A campsite on Loon Lake is accessible via the Bryce Breon Trail.\r\n\nAt the west end of the Gunflint Lake Ridge is an overlook at towering cliffs. After a dip to the north shore of Loon Lake, the trail ascends again to a ridge north of Crab Lake. A spur to the north leads to Bridal Veil Falls. Crab Lake Trail splits off to the south, and the BRT continues in a near strait line until bending on the southern rim of South Lake.\r\n\nThe middle section is a pattern of ascents to overlooks and descents to a lake, creek, or falls. Here are the popular Watap Lake overlook, Rose Lake overlook and lake shore campsites, Stairway Portage and waterfall, among others. You're likely to encounter more people in this stretch than other parts of the trail as you pass portages and lake-accessible campsites. As a result, the trail is often in great condition.\r\n\nWandering from the international border, the trail passes the shores of Rove, Clearwater, and Gogebic Lakes, with routine large climbs between. After passing a boat launch at MacFarland Lake, it meets up with the border again and follows the South Fowl Lake Portage. A flat stretch through forest and tall grasses leads to the final ascents and a spur to the 270-Degree Overlook, also the terminus of the Superior Hiking Trail.

Dorer Memorial Hardwood Forest features a long and winding trail system through forested hills, open prairies, and the occasional crop ground.\r\n\nThe trail system has two access points, both off gravel roads accessed via Hwy 61. One is off of 608th Street and one is off of T-152 (with a primitive campground). There is excellent signage directing users to the unit off of Hwy 61. \r\n\nThe trail purportedly has a 13.5-mile loop, though it is a tad confusing as the \"loop\" also includes a lollipop on the west end, and several spur trails which can lead unwary users astray. Most of the junctions have a map with an icon marking \"you are here,\" and for the most part they are accurate. A few, however, do NOT have the icon, which means users can spend a lot of time trying to figure out their location. When in doubt, staying to the left will keep you on the outer loop. \r\n\nUsing this strategy from the EAST access, the trail climbs steeply through the first few tenths of a mile over cobbly dirt before topping out into a forest/prairie area. The trail lopes enjoyably through rolling terrain. The trail snakes back on itself quite a bit in the first few miles, and meets several junctions: remember to turn left unless the goal is to get turned around.\r\n\nOn the south end, the trail straightens out as it travels through a gorgeous pine stand; a few wet spots stand out amongst the otherwise dry, rutty, and rooty dirt path.\r\n\nThe stretch of pines is fairly long, and ends in a T-junction: THIS IS THE MOST CONFUSING SECTION. A left turn here will take users out to the lollipop, the end of which is roughly the loop's halfway point. A nice vista provided by powerline right of way tells you you're on this section - it's the only \"wow\" view on the trail.\r\n\nAfter the lollipop, continue back along a track running parallel to the pine stand. The next left is a gravel road with \"no motorized vehicles allowed;\" this route will take users down across a creek and dump them out on a T-152, which can be followed back to the campground.\r\n\nTo stay on the dirt, skip this turn and resume to the left. The trail descends steeply to the northern side and flattens out again, before climbing back to the starting point.
