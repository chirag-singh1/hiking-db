Hood. Timberline Trail takes off at a sharp angle from the PCT and heads to Ramona Falls. This popular waterfall is best visited on weekdays or earlier morning weekends. Just beyond the falls is the intersection with the Ramona Falls Trail. Bear to the right (northwest) and begin hiking up Yokum Ridge. At the ridgeline, you pass the intersection with Yokum Ridge Trail #771 on your right (east). Continue down the north side of Yokum Ridge into the Muddy Fork drainage. \r\n\nThe Muddy Fork section of the Timberline Trail used to be the PCT and older maps and guidebooks still refer to it as such. However, the erosion and windstorm blowdown issues in the loose unstable volcanic ash make keeping the trail stable and wide enough for equestrians (PCT standards) infeasible. Therefore, the PCT was relocated further downstream, and this section was labeled the Timberline Trail. This section of trail has some of the steepest and most unstable sideslopes. \r\n\nLess than a mile past Yokum Ridge Trail #771 intersection, you begin crossing in and out of steep side drainages. These are where trail slides most often occur. If you arrive early in the season before trail maintenance occurs, be willing to detour back to the PCT. Crossing the Muddy Fork drainage is another challenge as there is no bridge. The river is braided over a 0.5 mile wide crossing. Utilize river safety crossing strategies in this area. The climb up Bald Mountain on the north side of the Muddy Fork is slightly steeper but does not slide out as often.  \r\n\nAbout 1.5 miles after crossing the Muddy Fork, you come to a 300 foot shortcut user trail that takes you to the ridgeline of Bald Mt on the section of Timberline Trail that takes you to McNeil Point. The shortcut connector used to be marked with a cairn, but signs may mark it now. If you skip the short cut, you soon get to the fabulous viewpoint of Mt. Hood from Bald Mountain in a wildflower meadow. You then head to the intersection with the PCT.

But when the snow melts, the summit can be accessed on a well-established trail. Although the hike up Mount Bachelor is less well-known than the hike up its taller neighbor (South Sister), the views are every bit as good. In particular, the summit of Mount Bachelor offers great views of the Cascade Lakes area, as well as the Sisters and Broken Top. And much like South Sister, Cascade peaks from Mount Adams down to Mount Shasta can be seen from the summit. This makes Mount Bachelor a great alternative or addition to South Sister.\r\n\nThere are a few ways to reach the summit of Mount Bachelor. But perhaps the most straightforward is the Sunrise to Summit Trail. This trail starts at the parking lot of the Sunrise Lodge at the ski area. This lot appears to be closed at the summit. But parking is available at the entrance to the lodge. You can then hike in on the road. There are a couple of trails you can take that shortcut the road and go to different levels on the parking lot. If you go straight, you'll get pretty close to the beginning of the trail.\r\n\nThe trail starts out climbing through a lush forest. The climb here is not too steep, but is fairly steady. As you climb higher, the trees start to get smaller and thin out as you climb above 7300 feet (or so).\r\n\nAs you climb higher, the trail starts to become more rocky and exposed. It also gets significantly steeper as you get closer to the summit. In a few places, you feel as if you have to climb over a few rocks. But nothing too serious. There are also a few spots where the trail becomes harder to follow. But arrows have been painted on the rocks in order to help with navigation. When you have reached the top of the ski lift, you are close to the summit.\r\n\nThere doesn\u2019t seem to be any designated official summit on Mount Bachelor. But it appears that the westernmost summit is the highest. Regardless, is not terribly hard to hit all of the highest points, so take some time and explore. You'll find that some are better than others in terms of the views that can be seen from each.

Different species come into bloom throughout the season to change the meadows complexion.\n\nIn average winters, 50 feet of snow falls on Castle Crests slopes. Seeds, roots, and runners of a host of plants lie dormant beneath the snowpack.

They often perch on one of the nearby power line towers as others continue to sail in the currents.\r\n\nCare should be taken when hiking down the steep end of the trail, as small rocks can be a hazard.

About halfway down, you'll come to what many consider the centerpiece of Forest Park, the Big Stump. The very large stump is the remains of an old-growth Western Red Cedar that was logged years ago.

Although the trail begins on one side of the mountain, reaches near the summit, and descends to the other side of the mountain, most people will only do half the trail as an out and back (unless they are doing the Oregon Coast Trail of which this is a part). The easiest and most popular route is from the south to the viewpoint and back, but people looking for a slightly greater challenge/fewer families can easily do the north to viewpoint route. \r\n\nParking for the south end is available up a short dirt road. Parking will fill up fast and cars will begin parking along the edge of the road by 10am or so. Parking for the north end is available at an obvious pull off on the opposite side of Highway 101 from the trail. Both ends are marked on 101. \r\n\nThe south end begins climbing along switchbacks right from the trailhead, through narrow singletrack that can be close to overgrown. Eventually the singletrack will enter evergreen forest and feel a bit wider/easier to pass, but it will also be covered with more roots - pay attention to where you step! After a little less than a mile you'll cross a forest road at a clear intersection. The trail can be very muddy from there out, but is less steep. \r\n\nAfter about 1.4 miles, the trail will switch from the east to the west side of the mountain, and you'll come to the main view point. However, there is an informal trail just before this viewpoint at the sharp turn in the trail from east to west that leads up a scramble to a better view. Both the viewpoint and the higher point have steep cliff faces, so watch children. \r\n\nTo get to the north end of the trail continue along the trail, descending a little. The best views are done. You'll pass around the main summit of the mountain before you begin descending in earnest. The way down consists of may switchbacks, lots of roots, and lots of mud. The northern end is lower than the southern end by a little over 300 feet, and is about a mile farther from the main viewpoint - hence why it is a little less family-friendly than the southern approach. Be careful crossing 101 to get to the parking area! \r\n\nNote, Short Sands Beach is only one mile north on 101 from the north end of this trail, and is a beautiful beach.

Offering a good climb, the trail takes you up to amazing views from a lookout atop Waldo Mountain, then down towards Lake Chetlo and to other trails that will take you to the western shore of Waldo Lake.\r\n\nShortly after leaving the trailhead following Salmon Lakes Trail #3585, you reach the junction with Waldo Mountain Trail #3585, which bears left (north) and uphill. Turn left here and start a steady climb that will gain you almost 2,000 feet in about three miles. Two miles from the trailhead, you'll intersect the Waldow Meadows Trail #3591, but continue climbing on the #3592 so that, at three miles, you reach the Waldo Mountain lookout. From there, you'll have great views all along the spine of the Cascade Crest, of the Three Sisters to the northeast, and of myriad smaller lakes to the north and south. Waldo Lake will be visible to the southeast.\r\n\nPer the Forest Service, the \"Waldo Mountain Lookout is maintained and staffed by Middle Fork Ranger District. It is an especially valuable observation post during the frequent lightning storms along the Crest. Though built in the 1950s, it is outfitted and furnished with original furniture and cabinetry, making it very authentic as well as comfortable.\" \n\nFrom the lookout, Waldo Mountain Trail #3592 descends a rocky ridge before terminating at the junction with the Winchester Ridge Trail #3596 about 3.7 miles from the trailhead. The delightful Lake Chetlo is a short ways east along the Winchester Ridge Trail #3596 and then the Wahana Trail #3583. \r\n\nBe prepared for mosquitoes in the early summer.  The trail surface is smooth dirt or duff (few rocks or roots) to the west of the lookout; similar to the east of the lookout but with a few rockier sections coming down the ridge.", "features": "Commonly Backpacked \u00b7 Lake \u00b7 Swimming \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildflowers", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7042408/the-cascade-crest-and-the-three-sisters-from-waldo-mountain", "ratings": {"rating": 4.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 3.7, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [6285, 4444], "alt-change": [1842, 575], "avg-grade": 12.0, "max-grade": 38.0}},

A large national forest trailhead sign sits just to the south of the Sharps Creek road entrance, but the trail is easier to access if you hike down the gravel road to the south for about 50 feet (to make sure you're oriented correctly, put the fire lookout tower on Fairview Peak at your back. The road you see ahead of you is the one you want to approach). On your right in the trees, you'll see a smaller trail sign for Bohemia Mountain.\r\n\nFrom there, the trail proceeds clearly for 0.75 of a mile up the mountain. You'll pass various trees marked with \"bearing tree\" signs, as well as one filled-in mine shaft (stick to the trail for safety). If you have come in July or early August, you'll come upon wildflowers like Indian paintbrush, columbine, and various asters. Several spots with views of the hills south of the Willamette valley and the coast range are interspersed along the climbing trail so you can take breaks as needed. The trail alternates steep sections with flat, and packed dirt with piled shale. One false summit gives early views of the mountains and surrounding hills.\r\n\nThe summit is nearly 360\u00b0, and on a clear day you can see mountains from Mt. Hood to Mt. Shasta, including Mt. Washington, Mt. Jefferson, the Three Sisters, Mt. Bachelor, and others. The top is fairly broad, with lots of flat areas to rest. At its eastern extremity, you can look back down to Bohemia Saddle where you started, and also to some old buildings that were part of the Bohemia mining district. Above all these you'll see the Fairview Peak watchtower, a fire lookout since the 1920s that was also used as a radar station in the 1950s and 1960s.

It is a popular mountain biking trail too, so be on the lookout for bikes, especially at intersections. Bikers should yield to hikers. Trailhead parking is available in several places near or along the trail designated by a \"P\" on the map. \r\n\nMany loops off the Crosstown Trail can be made to extend your hike. Some of these are connector trails (Skiway, Wally's, Maggie's, Lucy's, etc.) to conveniently bring you directly to Mt. Hood Brew Pub for micro-brews, The Huckleberry Inn for a huckleberry milkshake, or any other local dining establishment. The Crosstown Trail has plenty of huckleberries, but get there early before the locals pick them all. \r\n\nThe Crosstown Trail is native surface with some gravel in a few wet areas. The east end is a rockier trail bed, while the west end has a much smoother native surface through forest. Check out the video for more details. \r\n\nThere are five large bridges built for a nordic ski trail groomer in winter. The trail is mostly downhill from east to west, but there are moderate climbs and drops along the way. The trail can get dusty during extended dry spells. \r\n\nMost of the Government Camp Trail System is designed for beginner hikers including children and seniors. The trail system stretches from the Timberline Lodge above to Trillium Lake below. Combining Crosstown Trail with Summit Trail #691, you can make a large four-mile loop around the town on both sides of Hwy 26 (cross at the blinking yellow lights with caution!), or hike down to Trillium Lake for a refreshing swim. \r\n\nMost of the trail intersections are numbered, and trailhead maps, trail brochures, and online trail maps will help map reading challenged folks to find their way around easily.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildflowers", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7023012/crosstown-trail-near-the-trailhead-at-summit-ski-area-and-sno-park-provides-grea", "ratings": {"rating": 4.0, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 2.8, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [4089, 3627], "alt-change": [121, 469], "avg-grade": 4.0, "max-grade": 14.0}},

This collection of buildings was once home to the Summit Ranger District. Hike past the largest building at the bottom of the hill - the bunkhouse. A traillhead board has an orientation map to help with navigation form there.\r\n\nFollow the trail through the forest and past the turnoff to the winter Hemlock Ski Trail. Continue southeast to where the trail crosses Still Creek and comes out in the middle of the Still Creek Campground on Forest Road 2650 aka East Perry Vickers Rd. Hikers may also park at this end of the trail within the campground.\r\n\nThis trail was once a part of the Historic Barlow Road, one of the last legs of the Historic Oregon Trail. Where the trail meets the Still Creek Campground, there is the site of a former historic resort called Swim, which was most active during the 1920\u2019s.  Various foundations from the facility, including an old pool, can still be found.\r\n\nBarlow Trail connects Still Creek Campground with Government Camp. Due to its historic value as part of the Barlow Road, it is a bit more primitive than most trails in the area to preserve its historic characteristics.

Follow this trail as it descends towards East Fork of Hood River and Sahalie Falls. In less than a mile, you are above the river and from there, you parallel the river downstream towards the falls. There is a short very steep side trail off the main trail on your right towards the falls and the old highway. For photo shoots, the waterfalls is easier and safer to access from above the old highway. \r\n\nContinue east through forest as the trail descends and crosses the old highway Forest Road 3545 twice with a crossing of Meadow Creek in between. The second crossing is at the Elk Park Trailhead which can be busy. The Sahalie Falls Trail picks up on the north end of the roadside parking lot. Continuing east, you begin climbing slightly and cross over four cross-country ski trail corridor openings.

The trailhead is now at the west end of the Mt. Hood Skibowl Ski Area. The trails is about 1.4 miles longer round-trip than it was before. The hike around the lake is 4.5 miles round-trip. Hiking to Tom, Dick & Harry, makes it 8.3 miles round-trip. The new plaza has a restroom and interpretive signs. The first 1000 feet of the trail is paved and barrier free as it switchbacks down to a platform along Camp Creek.  \r\n\nFrom that point, the trail narrows and is dirt. Ten bridges were added to the new trail. After crossing Camp Creek, there are a series of six more bridges as the trail heads west, through thick forests of western red cedar, Douglas fir, and hemlock, before crossing a powerline corridor. At that point, the trail drops slightly to the northwest, switchbacks, and ties into the old Mirror Lake Trail. \r\n\nThe trail heads south, crossing the powerline again, before climbing two switchbacks and arriving at the lake. The most scenic loop around the lake is to stay to the right at the first intersection. Hike the west side of the lake, accessing the shoreline on the stairs and rock access points. The best views are at the southwest corner of the lake, but these are also the wettest sections, so please stay on trail and boardwalk. On clear, still days, you can get the namesake picture of Mt. Hood to the northeast. Skirt the spirea shrubs on the east side of the lake, before crossing the bridge over the lake's outlet creek and completing the loop.\r\n\nMost hikers then return to their car, but for those wanting longer and steeper, retrace the west shoreline and stay to the right at the next intersection climbing up to Tom, Dick and Harry Mountain. The trail heads west, gradually, but steadily climbing, as it wraps around the northwest side of the mountain.  The trail crosses a talus opening and the head of a drainage, before ducking back into the smaller true fir and mountain hemlock forest. The trail climbs up to the saddle that drops into Wind Creek basin. At this point, the trail heads east and really starts climbing along the ridgeline, before breaking out in the open, rocky outcroppings near the top.  \r\n\nThe official trail ends at the first peak offering 360-degree views of the Portland-metro area, Mt.

The bridges were designed to pass a trail groomer for winter cross-country skiing. The trail continues southeast towards Multorpor Fen, a large wet area between Skibowl and Highway 26. As it skirts the wet area, you can see skunk cabbage and other signs of approaching wetlands. The trail then comes out to the base of the Multorpor chairlift and the Lake Road. There are some points where Skibowl's fee mountain bike trails may be encountered from here to the east.  \r\n\nTurn left and follow the Summit Trail. The Lake Road splits. Bear to the right, follow the road/trail and pass under another chairlift. Continue east skirting above some buildings and below a yurt.

The road climbs a hill, and when you get over the other side, you pass a powerline corridor on your right (south) with access to a Skibowl fee Powerline Trail.\r\n\nJust after that, there is a connector trail between Summit Trail and the Barlow Trail #601A. The Summit Trail then swings north heading towards Highway 26. The trail passes an A frame building that houses generators for Portland General Electric. The trail can be followed to the highway where it comes out across from the Summit Ski Area Sno-Park, just east of the yellow blinking light intersection with the Government Camp Loop Road. If you don't want to cross the highway, you can stage a car at the ODOT Maintenance area Sno-park. If you do this, take the trail just south of the PGE A-frame building that heads east towards the old Forest Service compound.

Both trails allow bikes. The 13-mile loop trail around Timothy Lake is made up of the Timothy Lake Trail #528, the Southshore Trail #529 and the Pacific Crest Trail #2000.\r\n\nStarting at the Pine Point Day Use Area, the loop trail around Timothy Lake may be taken clockwise or counter-clockwise.  The following description is based on a counter-clockwise trip. From the south end of the dam at the Pine Point Day Use Area, begin working along the shoreline headed east.  \r\n\nYou'll pass a couple of fishing piers and a boat ramp in the Pine Point Campground. At this point, you'll be moving past campsites and in some cases, campers may extend their tents near or across the trail. This will be the case in the other 4 campgrounds you'll cross through. Continue past the campsites, round the shoreline and you'll be entering into The Cove Day Use Area. This used to be a bunch of walk-in campsite but it has since been reconstructed into a day use area to concentrate day use away from camping areas. The day use area has an amphitheater and playground as well as picnic tables. At the end of The Cove Day Use Area, this section of the Southshore Trail ends and becomes the Timothy Lake Trail #528.  \r\n\nContinue past the Cove and get to the short stretch of undeveloped part of the south shoreline. As you approach the Gone Creek Campground, the second segment of the Shoreline Trail picks up again. Continue through Gone Creek Campground and cross a boat ramp and shoreline use area. Just past a cluster of campsites, you soon come to more campsites that are the Oak Fork Campground, with another boat ramp and use area. The Southshore Trail continues for another 1/3 mile east till it comes to the intersection with the Timothy Lake Trail #528 again.

The PCT on the east shore makes up the third trail in the loop.  The Timothy Lake Trail on the south side of the lake has slightly more elevation gain and drop, but avoids the high use areas in the campground maintaining a pleasant forested outing.\r\n\nStart at the Little Crater Lake Campground Dayuse area.

At just under a half mile into the hike you'll pass a large talus field with some maples that offer nice fall colors and then hit the first of the switchbacks. Nearly the entire remainder of the trail will be switchbacks that keep the grade reasonable for how much elevation you're knocking out. The surface is rocky and can be loose so mind your footing. About 1/3 of the way up the views to Jefferson open up - and what views they are! From this point on there are few trees to obstruct views or offer shade (so be prepared for lots of sun exposure). Although Jefferson dominates, you'll be treated to great views to the south as you gain elevation, including Three Finger Jack, Mount Washington, the Sisters, and more. At about the 1.25 mile mark the switchbacks stop and the trail instead climbs steadily northwest and then wraps around the back of the summit to avoid another talus field on the southern face. This last section can be snow covered into July as it's wooded and north/northwest facing unlike the exposed southern face you've come up. \r\n\nThe summit is broad and rocky with plenty of room to rest and offers 360 degree views of everything from Rainier to Diamond Peak.", "features": "Commonly Backpacked \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 Views", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7070498/mount-jefferson-and-three-finger-jack-on-a-cloudy-day", "ratings": {"rating": 5.0, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 1.8, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [6025, 4358], "alt-change": [1667, 0], "avg-grade": 18.0, "max-grade": 35.0}},

You'll have excellent views of nearby Coffin Mountain and Jefferson to the east along with Three Fingered Jack, down to the Sisters, and up to Hood. \r\n\nThe trail is marked with only a sign post and clear dirt singletrack leading steeply to the northwest from the small parking area. Initially the trial is fairly steep, but well made and helped by a switchback.  Shortly after the switchback the trail's grade will mellow out and exit the forest. For the next 2/3 of a mile you can expect nice views of Three Fingered Jack and the Sisters, but not yet Jefferson. At about a mile the trail will enter young recovering forest mixed with wildflowers through which you might catch a glimpse of Jefferson. After passing Bugaboo Ridge Trail #3423 at a signed intersection the forest gets briefly very dense with bowed and stunted trees. The forest will thin, opening views to the southeast back up, and pass an interesting rock spire made of horizontal columnar basalt. The final push up Bachelor consists of a few sun-exposed switchbacks on looser rock. The summit offers excellent views and evidence of the former fire tower.", "features": "Views \u00b7 Wildflowers", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7071233/on-top-of-bachelor-mountain-looking-at-mount-jefferson", "ratings": {"rating": 4.7, "num_reviewers": 3}, "stats": {"dist": 1.9, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [5891, 4840], "alt-change": [1150, 149], "avg-grade": 13.0, "max-grade": 81.0}},

The trail begins climbing switchbacks on the north face of Triangulation Peak. Early on a small spur leads to the top of Spire Rock if you fancy. Continue climbing south on the steady grade. The trial is pretty well made and has good shade so it's relatively easy going. At about a half mile keep an eye out for the unmarked trail to Boca Cave which is very cool. The trail then wraps around a large open summit that once housed a fire watchtower. A small rock spire offers a mini-scramble to the true high point but the fire watchtower base is where most people will enjoy the 360 degree views from.", "features": "Views", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7072599/mount-jefferson-from-the-summit-of-triangulation-peak-with-the-fire-form-the-202", "ratings": {"rating": 5.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 0.6, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [5297, 5041], "alt-change": [272, 233], "avg-grade": 15.0, "max-grade": 52.0}},

Until the mid-1980s the #1166 was reportedly maintained every other year. Since it wasn't in a designated wilderness area, it was also identified by the Forest Service as a high quality motorized route, offering experienced motorcyclists a near wilderness experience. In 1987 the area traversed by the trail was swept by the Silver Complex Fire and then, in 2002, by the even bigger Biscuit Fire. By 2015 the Forest Service had concluded that only the four-mile long segment from the Illinois River Trail to Silver Peak could be maintained for motorized use (but only during the deer and elk hunting seasons (September to May)). Almost the entire trail was burned (again) by the 2018 Klondike Fire. \r\n\nThis trail is no longer maintained and maybe very difficult to follow in several places due to heavy brush if you start at its upper end. Others have reported that the trail can also be difficult to find and follow starting from its intersection with the Illinois River Trail #1161. The only water source along the #1166 is a spring (that may be seasonal) that is 3 miles from the eastern trailhead - the remainder of the trail is waterless. While you may find this trail mapped on USFS maps, it is not a recommended hike due to it current unmaintained state. You should definitely check with the USFS as to current conditions before attempting this hike.", "features": "Spring \u00b7 Views", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7057467/descending-from-the-upper-trailhead", "ratings": {"rating": 2.0, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 17.8, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [4287, 802], "alt-change": [6879, 3395], "avg-grade": 11.0, "max-grade": 67.0}},

The trail is faint at first but becomes progressively easier to follow as it ascends short switchbacks through the forest to a level area. From here, it contours below Brandy Peak and then descends to its southern trailhead on FR 2038. This trailhead is also unsigned and even more difficult to see than the northern one.\r\n\nA clear use trail to the summit of Brandy Peak leaves the #1147 about 0.6 miles from the northern trailhead and makes an ascending traverse to the peak's rocky summit.

But hikers who push through its challenging grade will be rewarded with one of the Columbia River Gorge's most scenic and satisfying trails, following a creek creating several gorgeous waterfalls.\r\n\nThe trail begins off Highway 30 near a parking area. The initial portion is a moderate climb on paved doubletrack, often crowded. It's only a single switchback to reach the first waterfall, Lower Wahkeena, which is crossed by a scenic stone bridge. Take time to appreciate the view, because the hike gets tough fast, beginning a steep grade climb that will last for about a mile. A few benches along the way provide rest opportunities.\r\n\nWahkeena soon begins a series of tight switchbacks, climbing along a creek of the same name to the right. The trail and creek take up almost the entirety of the space in this tight canyon. As the hairpins smooth out, look for a short spur to Lemmon's Viewpoint on the right; the view from here is outstanding.\r\n\nAfter Lemmon's, the pavement gives way to wide dirt singletrack, interrupted in some areas by jagged rocks and roots. Step carefully through these sections, especially where it\u2019s made wet by spray from the falls. Upper Wahkeena is a short distance ahead, as the path starts to made wider curves as it ascends. The climb is relentless and tiring.\r\n\nShortly before the three-quarter mile point, a number of tight switchbacks climb next to the gorgeous fan-shaped Fairy Falls. Watch your step here, as the ground is perpetually wet, and icy in winter. Vista Point Trail breaks off to the left, a nice shortcut for hikers heading west. Pressing on, the switchbacks widen a bit and the grade eases - marginally. Angel's Rest Trail #415 awaits at the mile point, while Wahkeena's route turns left. Take time to check Wahkeena Springs to the right, the source of the creek, before continuing on.\r\n\nEnjoy the view of the towering pines as the path finishes out its climb, eventually meeting Vista Point again near the mile and a half point. This flat section is also the trail's quietest, curving around the mountain. The trail is also drier and softer here, but watch for jagged rock segments.\r\n\nAs the trail turns toward the canyon of Multnomah Creek to end, it begins a descent as steep as the climb. Silence gives way to the roar of waterfalls below over the last quarter mile.

Watch for one of the area's typical wooden signposts marking the start. Vista Point is a pleasant, narrow, dirt doubletrack, with an ample covering of pine needles underfoot. The soft surface, along with only the occasional root or rock to dodge, make this a welcome change from some of the jagged stretches hikers climb to get here.\r\n\nMost of the area's plant life can be seen along the way, though hikers' views of the Columbia will depend heavily on the time of year and leaf growth. After heavier rains, some debris can be found scattered across the trail. Westbound, it's a quick descent. For those moving in the opposite direction, the climb has some tough moments but is manageable. This is one of the area's easier routes.\r\n\nAt Vista Point's northernmost tip, where the ascent levels out around a half mile in, watch for a short viewpoint spur to the right. This is the easiest spot to catch a view of the Columbia, especially in the warmer months. A few step-like features follow as the trail makes a mostly flat finish back to Wahkeena.

Good boots, good route-finding skills, a lot of stamina, and dry weather are essential. This route is not maintained, marked, or part of the USFS trail system, so use at your own risk. The ridge can be ascended when there is snow on the Benson Plateau but finding the start of the descent route (the Ruckel Creek Trail #405) can be very difficult when it's covered with snow.\r\n\nThe Ruckel Ridge use-trail starts from the end of the Buck Point Trail #439. The #439 starts between camp sites 5 and 6 in the Eagle Creek Campground and goes up from there through a series of switchbacks, across a clearing, under the power line, and to the edge of the trees where it officially ends. The Ruckel Ridge Trail simply continues as an obvious use trail from where the #439 ends.\r\n\nThe use-trail to the ridge dips downhill and to the right, then traverses a lichen-covered talus slope. Switchback up the rockslide, following occasional cairns to the crest of the ridge, using your hands as needed. After reaching the top of the talus and scree, the trail then ascends directly up the crest of the ridge, alternating between steep sections and very steep sections. In places, following the \"trail\" involves short Class 2/easy Class 3 scrambling \u2014 not technical rock climbing - but you'll have to use your hands a lot.\r\n\nAfter about two miles and at about 2,700 feet, you'll come to The Catwalk, a very exposed section on the crest of the ridge. This narrow section can be traversed carefully with hands, feet, and patience. For hikers who want to experience Ruckel Ridge but don't like exposure, there's an alternate \"bail-out\" path below The Catwalk on the south side.\r\n\nThe Catwalk marks the end of the scrambling, as the trail drops into a saddle and then begins an increasingly steep climb to the Benson Plateau. This part is mostly in the trees, but there is a rocky outcrop next to the trail at about 3,200 feet from where you can get a view of Tanner Butte and the Eagle Creek drainage. This is a nice spot for a break and/or a snack.\r\n\nThe use-trail can get a little sketchy once you finally level off on the plateau at 3,700 feet, but continue heading northeast, descend to a crossing of Ruckel Creek (by wading or rock hopping), and then make a short ascent to a junction with the Ruckel Creek Trail #405.

I was one of the crew members that built the trail. There were five of us on the trail crew. We would head in and work for 10 days then 4 days off. Pack mules brought our supplies in - tent, cots, chain saw, fuel, dynamite, rock drill, food and misc. other supplies.\r\n\nOur first camp was at North Lake, it was late spring or early summer and still lots of snow. We used them as a refrigerator and drinking water. As we got closer to Lake Ivern, we moved our camp to the lake. Most of the snow was gone and the trail went past some springs. We used the best spring, Buckley Spring (mine), for water and we put a large bucket in it covered with a burlap tarp. We put our perishables in the bucket and the evaporation from the wet tarp kept things cool.\r\n\nOne night we had quite a discussion about the progress we were making on the trail and the issue of naming things came up. The decision was made: we built the trail so it must be our responsibility to name things. The crew was down to 4 because a slacker got fired. The foreman, Frank, wasn't interested and neither was George so we came up with Jahn Spring (Phil Jahn), Buckley Spring (Bruce Buckley). One spring to go... North woods backcountry? Had to be Big Foot Spring. Then we promptly named our campsite \"Big Foot Spring Campground.\" I haven't seen any reference to the campground just Buckley Spring and Jahn Spring.\r\n\nI was using Google Earth and decided to look at Seven Lakes Basin. What a surprise to see the caption \"Buckley Spring\" and a picture. I never even considered that the name would stick - a real treat.\r\n\nIn August of 2015, I returned and headed about half way to Lake Ivern.

To add to the weight of this undertaking, there's little to no water along this trail, and blow down isn't uncommon. Most hikers will opt to to leave a vehicle at the Kinzel Lake Trailhead before hitting the trail.\r\n\nThe trail begins at the parking lot of the Zigzag Ranger District - interestingly the Hunchback Trail serves as a training climb for the Zigzag Hotshot firefighters who work in the adjacent offices. The trail passes by an old spring house covered in moss and begins climbing quickly through the thick green forest. \r\n\nThere's little time to settle into your pace as the trail climbs up sharp switchbacks at grades of 12-20%. After a half-mile, the trail really starts ramping up towards the ridgeline (which you'll reach at about mile 1.2), before it eventually drops to the west side for views into the Salmon River Canyon. The first viewpoint comes at about mile 1.6, where you can rest and recharge with a snack, scramble around the ridge line rocks, and hopefully enjoy the scenery looking up the Still Creek and Zigzag Canyons and peak over into the Salmon River Canyon. \r\n\nThe trail then continues more-or-less on the ridgeline, dropping to the east side of the ridge and skirting below a large talus slope and then dropping to the other side of the ridge. The alternating east-to-west dance continues along the sawtooth-like ridgeline as it heads southeast.\r\n\nJust after four miles of daunting ridgeline climbing and a catwalk-like traverse is the sign for a user trail going straight ahead to the \"Great Pyramid\" which offers views into Salmon River Canyon. The Hunchback Trail takes a hard left at this point, so do not follow the spur trail past the viewpoint! At this point, the trail drops sharply before again climbing to regain elevation along the ridgeline. At just over the 5.5-mile mark, you'll reach the intersection with Green Canyon Way Trail #793A on your right (west). \r\n\nFor the next 1.2 miles, the grade mellows out somewhat, before it once again starts climbing to the highest part of Hunchback Mountain that is just over 5,000 feet (you started at 1,440 feet) at almost eight miles in, where you reach the intersection with the Cool Creek Trail #794 and the Devil's Peak Lookout. \r\n\nAt this point, you can continue another mile-and-change to the southeast on the trail to the intersection with the Kinzel Lake Trail #665 and the trailhead parking at Kinzel Lake. Or you can turn around and punish your knees, and head back to the Hunchback Trailhead at Zigzag.", "features": "Fall Colors \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildflowers", "condition": "Minor Issues"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7062305/the-milky-way-above-devils-peak-lookout", "ratings": {"rating": 3.5, "num_reviewers": 4}, "stats": {"dist": 9.4, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [4999, 1443], "alt-change": [4833, 1767], "avg-grade": 13.0, "max-grade": 55.0}},

In the easternmost \"lower\" sections, the path is a patchwork of smooth and broken pavement. As the trail winds deeper into the forested hills, the pockets of pavement become more rough and destroyed, before the asphalt disappears entirely, and the path becomes entirely gravel. In the westernmost sections, the trail is a classic doubletrack, gravel logging road.\r\n\nThere's not much of an official trailhead. The trail starts unceremoniously at the Multnomah Channel without even an official parking lot. There are some pull-overs and short, foot trails to the start of the trail. A little over two miles in, the path crosses Highway 30. Here, there appears to be something resembling a trailhead, with a sign and a gravel lot. But there are No Parking signs and a sign designating parking is two miles up the Scappoose-Vernonia Highway.  \r\n\nThis first official parking lot seems to have been converted into a gravel dump spot for the transportation department, so you'll want to park off to the side and out of the way if you park here.\r\n\nFor several miles, the trail runs along the Scappoose-Vernonia Highway very closely.  For much of this, the trail flutters in and out of being open to vehicle traffic as access to people's driveways and the like, and then returning to closed-off-to-traffic, designated multi-use path.  \r\n\nEventually, the trail breaks away from the highway and runs through more wild forests. The westernmost section starts in a long, steeper climb as the route shifts from the original railroad bed into the logging truck road made in the forties.\r\n\nAt the top of this climb, the route reconnects with the Scappoose-Vernonia Highway.  A small gravel parking lot provides trail access. The path continues under a bridge and becomes the Columbia Forest Road at this point, leading to Vernonia.", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7029339/between-scappoose-and-chapman-landing-the-crown-zellerbach-trail-crosses-over-di", "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 14.0, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [1276, 14], "alt-change": [1278, 34], "avg-grade": 2.0, "max-grade": 10.0}},

This type of placer mining uses water discharged (through a nozzle called a \"giant\") under high pressure to wash away gravels and alluvial deposits, making a slurry that can be run through a sluice box or other equipment to recover the gold. It required considerable quantities of water, which was usually conveyed, often over long distances, in a ditch. Water pressure (the \"head\") was created by having the intake of the ditch at a higher elevation than the giant.\r\n\nIn the mid-1870s, J. T. Layton built (using Chinese labor) a 21 mile long ditch to bring water from upper Williams Creek to his mine in Ferris Gulch. This mine is considered by the Bureau of Land Management  to be the first hydraulic mine in Southern Oregon. Use of the ditch for mining continued at least into the 1920s and perhaps as late as 1940. After that the ditch fell out of use for mining and was eventually abandoned. In the mid-1990s the Bureau of Land Management cleared part of the ditch for a trail that travels in and out of federal lands, but that too fell into disrepair. More recently, a local community group has been clearing swaths of the trail for use by hikers, mountain bikers, and equestrians.\r\n\nThis northern section of the Layton Ditch Trail starts at Panther Gulch Road and goes north to just past the Chinese Wall. There is a trail marker and an interpretive sign at the trailhead. After 1.6 miles of essentially level travel from the trailhead, you come to the edge of private land at Cherry Gulch and two marijuana greenhouses, the construction of which destroyed a section of this historic ditch. Here the trail has been rerouted down and across Cherry Gulch to an old road on the other side.  After 0.6 miles along this old, level road, the ditch and the singletrack trail next to it reappear.\r\n\nAt 3.2 miles from the trailhead you'll reach the historical feature known as the Chinese Wall.  Here a rocky outcrop prevented the relatively simple digging of a ditch in dirt. The Chinese laborers (see also the Gin Lin Mining Trail #917) who were building the ditch blasted a 6-foot deep channel through the outcrop and used the resulting rocks to construct walls to support the ditch. The ditch is no longer working but these walls are still holding strong after 140+ years. An uncleared section of the trail continues along the ditch for about another 0.4 miles to where it has been overtaken by a clearcut.", "features": "Historical Significance \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildflowers", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7077556/under-a-canopy-of-manzanita-along-the-layton-ditch-trail", "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 3.5, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [2448, 2163], "alt-change": [638, 714], "avg-grade": 7.0, "max-grade": 24.0}},

In 1986, about three miles upstream of the confluence, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began construction on what was expected to be the Elk Creek Dam. \r\n\nIn 1988, when the dam was only one third its designed height, construction was stopped by litigation and additional studies that demonstrated it did not make economic sense and would also significantly impact salmon. In 2008, the dam project was finally abandoned.\r\n\nIn anticipation of the dam being built, the old Elk Creek Road, which ran along the creek, had been replaced by a new Elk Creek Road well above the creek. In 2014, after replacement of bridges and the installation of trailheads with amenities, the Corps officially opened the old Elk Creek Road and surrounding lands to the public as a new park for hiking and biking. \r\n\nThis trail is that old road. Parking lots have been installed at the northern (Homesteader's) and southern (Yellow Rock) trailheads.  The old road is no longer maintained but is easy walking in all weathers, even when the surrounding terrain is muddy.  There are wildflowers in the Spring and colored leaves in the Fall. It's just a good place for a nice hike.\r\n\nThe road approaches the creek in only a few spots. About 1 mile south of the northern trailhead you can leave the paved road on a dirt road that closely follows the creek to a small, part sand, part cobble beach.

T. Layton built (using Chinese labor) a 21 mile long ditch to bring water from upper Williams Creek (Pipe Fork) to his mine in Ferris Gulch. Along the way, the ditch crossed what is today Panther Gulch Road. Several years ago, the Bureau of Land Management, in cooperation with local volunteers, restored the trail along side this ditch north from Panther Gulch Road to the Chinese Wall (Layton Ditch Trail (North)). Plans were then laid to restore the ditch trail south from Panther Gulch to its start at Pipe Fork. Although this restoration is still a work in progress, the trail is currently relatively easy to follow between these two points - but in a few spots you may have to search some for the trail's continuation.\r\n\nThe ditch was graded at about 14 feet per mile (0.5 inches per rod), so you hardly notice that you are hiking \"uphill\" as you go south toward its source at Pipe Fork. About a mile south of Panther Gulch, the ditch is cut by BLM Road 39-5-2 and you have to negotiate a slope before picking up the trail again.\r\n\nAt 1.6 miles, the ditch has been obliterated by a combination of natural erosion and road-building, so a trail has been built down and around this lost section. After a little less than a mile on this diversion, you get back to the ditch.\r\n\nAt 2.7 miles, you pass another future site of a trailhead and a kiosk, before turning north to go around the ridge between Panther Gulch and the East Fork of Williams Creek. The ditch is filled-in along here but reappears fairly soon.\r\n\nAt 3.8 miles you pass another future sign site and continue south along the west side of the ridge. This is the one of the few places where this trail offers a view of anything other than itself and forest. From here south, much of the ditch is still intact but sections of it had been obliterated by old roads so, for some short distances, these old roads became the trail.\r\n\nAt 5.5 miles, you pass a gravel road (BLM 39-5-14.2) coming up from the northwest. At some point in the future, a trailhead and a kiosk will be placed along it and its connector road (BLM 39-5-23.1). These stretches of old road do, occasionally, afford you a view of Big Sugarloaf Peak to the south. In it's last mile, the trail is unimpacted by roads and runs alongside a still evident ditch, just like it did back in the day. The trail ends in the forest above the East Fork of Williams Creek (site on another planned trailhead).", "features": "Historical Significance \u00b7 Wildflowers", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7080056/the-ditch-trail-near-its-end-at-pipe-fork", "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 7.5, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [2463, 2242], "alt-change": [1667, 1616], "avg-grade": 8.0, "max-grade": 28.0}},

There's an ATV Trail to cross and from there hikers make their way onto the sparsely forested side of the ridge. Things get loose and exposed on the the steep hillside. As the grade increases hikers will descend back into the trees for some switchbacks heading down to the spring. After the bridge, expect a short steep climb to an ATV road underneath powerlines.

Even if you are not interested in scrambling up these peaks, the expansive meadows at the head of Thorp Creek make an excellent destination for an overnight (or longer) backpack. In the otherwise busy Eagle Cap Wilderness, here your solitude is likely to be assured.\r\n\nAlthough abandoned, the trail is occasionally maintained by volunteers and is not difficult to follow once you cross Hurricane Creek and the grassy meadow on the east side of the creek. Follow the Hurricane Creek Trail #1807 for just under 2 miles, turn left (east) and cross the creek either on logs (preferred if the creek is running high) or, in the water is low in late season, by wading. Once across, head southeast, cross Twin Creek, and look for the well-defined use trail as it starts up the slope about 0.5 miles from the crossing.\r\n\nThe trail climbs steeply for about 0.5 miles, then its gradient eases as it starts into the Thorp Creek Valley. Be prepared for an amazing view of the north ridge of Sacajawea Peak from this section of the trail. At about 2.5 miles from the crossing, you'll enter the large meadow surrounding Thorp Creek. The spring-fed creek is a good source of water and campsites abound in the meadow.\r\n\nThe meadow is a great place as a backpacking destination or for scrambles to the summit of Sacajawea Peak or the Hurwal Divide.

The 2nd edition was released in 2002 and at that time the easiest way to access 1944 was to start from the Buck Creek Trailhead and hike the Elk Creek Trail 1944A (alternative) then onto 1944. The driving directions listed and map here shows starting from that same TH but makes no reference to 1944A so apparently trail numbers have changed a bit over time.\r\n\nI did about 3.75 miles to the junction with the China Ridge Trail 1906, and then up 1906. Therefore my experience and photos are limited the western portion of the 1944 trail. As you can see in the trail profile only a few sections are a steep grade, and I found it a pleasant journey overall.\r\n\nThere are views of the Elkhorns to the west, and from farther up the trail views of Burger Butte and China Cap. I suppose that even more spectacular sweeping views are available if you hike higher. We headed up China Ridge 1906 but unfortunately my hiking buddy became ill before we reached the ridge top, so we turned back. I suspect he had a bit of altitude sickness.\r\n\nI certainly did enjoy the absence of people on this hike.

Just follow the old road and you'll connect with the trail at Sunshine Flat. Because of shared use, this trail never becomes a narrow singletrack.\r\n\nFrom Sunshine Flat, the trail turns to the south and follows the ridge toward Lookout Mountain. It starts out in forest but, farther along, does pass through some nice meadows, all of which are filled with many different kinds of wildflowers in season. There are occasional views along the trail south toward Glacier and Lookout Mountains. This is easy hiking through wide-open country with expansive views and fields of wildflowers.\r\n\nFour miles from the trailhead, the Sunshine Flat Trail #369 ends at a junction with the Little Baldy Trail, which is now a faded doubletrack road.

Each subsequent section rewards hikers with increasingly impressive views of the area's rich geology, which echoes the red-rock formations and pillars that you'd only expect to find in Utah.\r\n\nFrom the trailhead, head north into the gulch along a sandy wash that winds beneath caves and towering overhangs. At .06 miles, keep right at the split to follow a small ridge up to a rocky amphitheater. From the amphitheater, there's a nice view of Mahogany Mountain to the south. The surrounding rocks and distant view make a good turnaround spot for hikers limited by time or looking to keep things easier.\r\n\nThe trail isn't over yet, though, as there are a few more great views to be had. To reach the next vantage point, continue left up the narrowing gulch to eventually complete a steep, challenging push to the saddle on the ridgeline above. From the top, enjoy a vast expanse that includes views of Lake Owyhee and the rippling ridges of the Owyhee Canyonlands.\r\n\nMost hikers will choose to turn around here but the trail does go on! For those that do press on the resulting views are well worth the extra push. From the saddle, the trail heads mostly south climbing the ridge right and left of various rock formations. On the way up the ridge, you'll see a structure off to the right. Have a look to satisfy tour curiosity but please respect what is left of it. Once you reach the top, you'll be rewarded with 360 degree views from Yellow Jacket Point.

The trail begins at the main (west) boat launch and officially terminates roughly a half mile before shown on the map. A very clear and well-worn boot path continues from that point to the smaller (east) boat launch. After this, the north section of the trail continues, but is only roughed-out and flagged and there is a lot of poison oak. I personally don't run this final section, preferring to run the groomed section out and back, but I have hiked it a couple of times, so I know it can be done as a loop. Another option is to run the road between the boat launches to complete the loop. A local mountain biking group has plans to finish the final section and make this a real loop trail, but I don't know when or if work is scheduled. Yes, this trail is open to non-motorized biking. However, I rarely run into bikers and when I have, they've always yielded. I rated this trail intermediate, based on the criteria, but it's really a pretty forgiving little trail. A few steep inclines, some rocks and roots, and in the winter a couple patches of gnarly clay mud add to its charm. The trail was recently (1/22) logged out, so there are currently no fallen trees to navigate, though after a heavy rain, wind or snow these \"hurdles\" can be a feature, too.

Hood Wilderness from just southeast of Lost Creek Campground, south to Enola Hill off Road 27 along Hwy 26. The first half of the trail is a moderate 3.5-mile one way (7 mile round trip) to the namesake lake. Hikers can continue up and over Zigzag Mountain if they stage a second vehicle at the Burnt Lake South Trailhead. Trail conditions and maintenance south of Burnt Lake drops off noticeably. Because of this, it's recommended that most hikers stick to the north half.\r\n\nThe first third of a mile of trail follows an overgrown logging road through an old timber sale unit. The next 1.5 miles of trail travels between two tributaries of Lost Creek, the one on your right (south) drains Burnt Lake and the larger stream to your left (north) is Lost Creek. In various drainages, you'll see fire-scarred snags and the occasional old growth cedar that survived the area's fire history.\r\n\nDuring the first 2.5 miles, the trail climbs about 1000 feet to a user-made spur that leads down to some falls and a campsite on Lost Creek. Just past there, the Burnt Lake Trail makes a large switchback southwest, towards the lake basin, climbing about 600 feet in the last mile. \r\n\nThe trail skirts the right (northwest) side of the lake with the best Mt. Hood views and photo opportunities towards the far end. At that point, there is a user trail that continues counter clockwise around the southeast side of the lake accessing additional day use and campsites. \r\n\nBoth day users and overnight campers need to stay in designated use sites to minimize use impacts and protect ongoing rehabilitation and restoration areas around the lake shore. Lettered sites (A,B,C etc.) are for day use only. Numbered sites are for day or overnight users.\r\n\nHikers should take a paper map with them. Options include the Government Camp USGS quad (available for download online), the Mt. Hood Wilderness map, the Mt. Hood National Geographic Map, or something of similar scale.

Turn to your left (east) when you get into the campground. Do not take the Sandy River Trail. Take the Cast Creek Trail out of the campground, and it soon crosses an old reclaimed road bed near a tributary drainage and then heads up a forested ridgeline to Zigzag Mountain, crossing the head of that same tributary stream. That is the only sign of water on the trail so take plenty of water for this dry 2,500-foot climb to the top of the mountain.  \r\n\nOnce at the top of the monotonous, though not punishing, climb to Zigzag Mountain, Cast Creek Trail offers nice views in the rhododendron openings. The trail tops out on the ridgeline and then drops over the other side a short ways to the end of the trail and the intersection with Zigzag Mountain Trail #775. At this point, you could continue west (right) on Trail #775 for 500 feet to the Cast Lake Trail #796 and continue 1/2 mile to Cast Lake.  Or you could turn east (left) on Trail #775 and hike the 1/2 mile along the ridgeline to one of the peak points along Zigzag Mountain to get more spectacular views of Mt.

Trail traffic is typically light to moderate with the most traffic seen from Devil\u2019s Tie Trail #767 to Horseshoe Ridge #774.  \r\n\nLeaving from Forest Road 1819 (1,600\u2019), the trail climbs steadily with 16 steep switchbacks over the first 1.5 miles before reaching the lower ridgeline of Zigzag Mountain (2770'). The trail continues climbing to 4500' at mile 4. Here you start seeing the spectacular views when you break out of the trees onto the rocky outcrops along the ridgeline.  The trail switches between the north and south side of the ridge giving you views to Mt. Adams, Mt. St. Helens, and Mt. Rainier on the north side, and Mt. Jefferson, and Three Sisters on the south side. Of course Mt. Hood looms to the east in front of you as you hike along the ridgeline.

This long, challenging hike can provide a real sense of accomplishment, but it can also break the spirits of those less prepared.  \r\n\nIt's a good idea to think of the trail as being split into two parts, divided by the summit at the Bell Camp Road Trailhead. The southern portion is a longer, more gradual climb up to the summit and the better part to hike. The northern section is much shorter, but also substantially steeper.\r\n\nStarting from the southern trailhead at Gales Creek Campground, the trail follows its namesake for a number of miles up the valley. After only about three-quarters of a mile, the trail crosses a bridge and immediately T's at a junction. Heading left would start the steep, sinewy climb up the Storey Burn Trail.  \r\n\nTurning right continues on Gales Creek Trail. The trail is often within sight or earshot of the creek as the singletrack winds along the ravines and gulleys that drain into Gales Creek. It makes for a lot of short, intermittent climbs and brief flat stretches, giving your legs relief from any one stretch of a sustained grade. It can feel rewarding nonetheless. Although not very technical for the most part, the ever-changing direction of the trail will keep you on your toes.\r\n\nAt about five-and-a-half miles, a short but super fun reroute of the trail brings some obvious MTB-inspired flow to the trail and is a beautiful section to explore, keeping an eye and ear toward fellow trail users on two wheels. The last half-mile is the steepest climb yet, but seeing the small parking lot for the Bell Camp Road Trailhead lets you know you're at the summit. This marks the end of the southern section of the trail.\r\n\nContinuing north on the trail begins a very steep downhill as the trail loses all of the elevation it just gained in about half the distance. Much of the upper mile is almost straight down with few switchbacks. It begins to mellow out eventually and the bottom mile or so feels more like the first part of the trail.\r\n\nThe Triple C Trail and Step Creek Trail loops can be found at the northern end of this trail, but only the strongest hikers will want to add these to their day because that intense downhill must now be conquered in the opposite direction to get back. It's exhausting and brutal and might rob you of any sense of accomplishment for the hike. Many hikers should consider just doing the Gales Creek - Southern Climb.

There is a decent sized parking lot at the trailhead for vehicles of all sizes. You can choose to go straight or take a left and follow the boardwalk around the hills. This description follows the path to the left.\r\n\nAs you leave the parking lot, the trail goes off to the right and follows a boardwalk that works its way around a red and yellow clay hill. There are several signs that speak to the fragile nature of the landscape, urging visitors to stay on the trail and not traipse on the barren slopes that are void of topsoil or plants. The path allows you to see the texture of the hills up close. The clay particles that make up the hill absorb rain water and make it very difficult for plants to draw the water from the ground. Underneath the surface, the hardpan nature of the soil prevents plant roots from penetrating the ground. When combined with the poor nutrient conditions and hot, dry summers of the Painted Hills area, it makes sense that plants have a hard time growing here.\r\n\nThe trail departs the boardwalk and climbs a hill behind the hill. Sinkholes and a watershed can be seen in this area as you climb above the hills you just passed. In the distance, you can see private property that lies outside the park boundary, including a couple of ponds that keep the land irrigated and cattle fed. It's a nice view, and one of the better ones on this trail. The trail then descends along the backside of the hill, which is separated from the hills by a log barrier. The trail passes a Rhyolite Flow (a lava flow), which is the lavender-gray layer off to the right of the trail. A bench sits off to the lefthand side where you can take a break and enjoy the scenery. Passing a sign that talks about the erosion that shaped the area, the trail emerges back at the parking lot.

Levi Scott and Jesse Applegate, who pioneered the southern wagon route into Oregon, named the creek in 1846 when they found a dead cow beside it (no grasping for literary allusions with these guys). The six mile long Cow Creek Trail (USFS #1424) follows the upper reaches of the South Fork of Cow Creek through an herb-rich floodplain stocked with mature and old (500+ years in some cases) Douglas fir and other trees. It ends at Railroad Gap near the divide that defines the watersheds of the Rogue and Umpqua Rivers.\r\n\nThe Cow Creek Trailhead (the Sharon Eitzen Memorial) is on Forest Road 3232 where it crosses the East Fork of Cow Creek and features a pit toilet, a hitching post, and parking for several vehicles.\r\n\nFrom the trailhead, the trail traverses into the drainage of the South Fork of Cow Creek, and after 0.5 miles you come to the first crossing of the creek. How you cross (and if you can cross) will depend on the water level. The trail itself is generally in good condition, with only a few short sections a little overgrown, and nothing that's rocky or steep.\r\n\nYou make your second crossing at 1.2 miles from the trailhead and your third at 1.4 miles. After that, the trail climbs up and away from the creek and contours through a luxuriant old-growth forest. You reach your fourth crossing at 3.75 miles from the trailhead. If old-growth was your primary interest, this makes a good turnaround point since you've gone through almost all of the old-growth. If you continue on, you'll find another crossing at five miles in and the trail's end at Forest Road 911 on Railroad Gap.\r\n\nThe gap got its name when, in the 1870s, the Oregon & California Railroad surveyed through here for a practical route from the Cow Creek drainage to the Rogue River. No such route was found, but the \u201cRailroad Gap\u201d name stuck. There also used to be a fire lookout at the gap. A 15-foot pole L-4 tower was built in 1933, used as part of an Aircraft Warning System (AWS) during World War II, and then removed in 1951.", "features": "River/Creek \u00b7 Swimming", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7045835/a-luxuriously-complex-riparian-old-growth-forest", "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 6.5, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [4106, 2438], "alt-change": [1979, 405], "avg-grade": 7.0, "max-grade": 28.0}},

This is a popular summer hike/climb and this trailhead can be busy on weekends and holidays.\r\n\nFrom the trailhead, the #1456 through lodgepole pine for the first mile and reaches a junction with the Spruce Ridge Trail #1458 after 1.5 miles. An excellent view of Mt. Thielsen presents itself just beyond this trail junction. Past here, the trail turns briefly south then swings west below the west ridge of Point 6832. At 2.8 miles from the trailhead, it makes a brief turn to the north and then follows Thielsen's northwest ridge to a junction with the PCT at 3.6 miles. Up to this point, the #1456 has been an established trail with a clear and easy tread.\r\n\nFrom the PCT, the #1456 proceeds up the ridge as an obvious scramble trail (this is a popular climb that sees a lot of use). Most of this portion of the #1456 is a steep hike up loose, dusty scree and small rocks - tedious but not difficult. There is some Class 2/3 scrambling just before you reach a small notch (\"Chicken Ledge\") about 80-feet below the actual summit of Thielsen. The views on the way up to this point are usually excellent and the notch makes a good goal for those not seeking the summit.\r\n\nFrom the notch on the southeast side of the pinnacle, you can see the 80-foot climb/scramble up the south face to the summit. Wear on the rock in spots points the way to go but just pick the easiest way up. The start is right in the notch and you angle slightly left as you climb. There may be a of couple Class 4 moves with exposure but the rock is fairly solid and blocky (but always test your hand and footholds first!). Most climbers don't protect this 80-foot section but whether you do so or not depends on your comfort/experience level. It's easy to rappell off the summit, so if you feel better protecting and rapping, do as a slip could mean injury or death. Also avoid getting too close to the right side of the south face, as the exposure over there is severe and the wind, which frequently whips across the ridge, can throw you off balance.", "features": "Views", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7046002/the-north-face-of-mount-thielsen-from-howlock-mountain", "ratings": {"rating": 4.4, "num_reviewers": 8}, "stats": {"dist": 4.6, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [8714, 5436], "alt-change": [3278, 321], "avg-grade": 15.0, "max-grade": 121.0}},

The first two miles are fairly flat followed by two steeper miles to viewpoints. It's lower elevations makes it accessible nearly year-round.  \r\n\nThe first section of trail is fairly narrow where the river has cut into the bank. The rest of the trail is wider with more distance to the river. Next you come to a side channel of the river reopened by the Forest Service to improve salmon habitat. On the far side of the channel is a large flat grove of old growth along the river shoreline. Next is the second narrow section that skirts the rocky shoreline with a deep pool of the Salmon River. Look out for namesake fish.\r\n\nStay on the trail to the first bridge at milepost one. The trail continues along the river with a view across the river of Big Horn Creek, a larger tributary coming in to the flow. Another 1/3 of a mile and you reach Rolling Riffle where there are some dispersed campsites. Just beyond the campsites is the two mile point where another bridge crosses a tributary, followed by the wilderness boundary, a trailhead board and wilderness permit box. \r\n\nAfter this, the trail begins a steady climb up and away from the river. At the three plus mile point, there is a side trail off the main trail to the right that brings you out of the forest and into a series of large moss covered rocky outcrops with viewpoints. From here, you can hear the roar and catch a glimpse of Final Falls and Frustration Falls upstream.  Continue hiking on the side loop in and out of openings. Vanishing Falls is the next waterfalls upstream. See caution below about outcropping cliffs.\r\n\nGet back onto the main trail and at milepost 4.7, you reach Goat Creek, another popular turnaround point or camping spot. For those who continue, the trail continues to climb well away from the river, passing the Kinzel Lake Trail #665 on your left and dropping and climbing out of side drainages. At about the eight-mile mark, the trail nears the river and Linney Creek Trail #499 will drop you to the river. Continue on Salmon River as it parallels the river sometimes within access to the water until you reach milepost 10.5.

It is also very smooth - few rocks or roots - so the going is surprisingly easy. Finally, it's gets very little use considering it's proximity to Portland. \r\n\nThe clearly signed trail begins where the road is blocked off to vehicles and descends a very steep ~15 feet down to the river before almost immediately climbing back up to the closed-off road.

You can see the South Fork valley and Sheepshead Rock. There won't be another clear viewpoint for about 2.5 more miles. At about 3.75 miles the trail appears to head out into a clearing because so many people miss the first true switchback here. There are only a few more switchbacks as the slope of Salmon Butte is gradual enough to not need many. \r\n\nFinally, at about 5 miles the trail curves around the ridge of Salmon Butte, enters tons of rhododendrons, and a few views to Hood briefly open up. The last mile of the trail is the loveliest thanks to the rhododendrons and other wildflowers. 3/4 of a mile from the summit the trail merges with an old road that bends around to the south side of Salmon Butte before the final ascent push. \r\n\nFrom the top you can expect to see St. Helens, Mount Rainier, Mount Adams, Mount Hood, Mount Jefferson, and a glimpse of the Three Sisters.

It is used as a connector trail for bicyclists, and is a main access trail to the most popular climbing area in the park.\r\n\nAs you start down River Trail you can observe the Picnic Wall, an area that has mostly advanced climbs.  Within the first 1/4 mile you'll pass under a Rhyolite intrusion to the welded tuft rock.  This striking red rock if very rough looking in a beautiful way.  On your left will be the Crooked River.  \r\n\nAs you continue down the trail it is easy to spot the rock climbers. There are many climbing access trails that break off to the right.  They are more narrow but will eventually lead you back down to the River Trail.  Shortly you'll pass the last bathroom, it's actually a compost vault toilet.  As you pass the Morning Glory Rock Formation you'll spot a rock that looks like a Snoopy Head, this is Asterisk Pass.  This trail is only recommended for experienced rock climbers as it is about 50 feet on a very narrow ledge with no protection.  \r\n\nJust past Asterisk Pass you begin to see the actual Smith Rock Group.  These rocks are very rugged.  The River Trail now bends around to the left.  You'll soon come to a house-sized boulder in the river, if you look across the river you'll see an ancient pine tree.  This tree has been the home of nesting Bald Eagles for the last 3 years.  Past the boulder, you'll reach the Southern Tip of Smith Rock.  There are several undercuts to the cliff where you can seek shade for a summer lunch or duck under to dodge the rare rain shower.  \r\n\nAs the trail turns north it narrows somewhat and begins to have small dips to go around ancient pine trees.  There are several access points along here so you can take a quick dip in the river to cool off in the summer.  As you pass the junction for the Mesa Verde Trail you'll be able to see the Monkey Face Spiral.  This is where most people split off to continue the Mesa Verde/Misery Ridge Loop. As a result, the River Trail continues to narrow somewhat and become overgrown until it connects to the Summit Trail.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7004510/looking-south-at-smith-rock-group-from-river-trail", "ratings": {"rating": 4.3, "num_reviewers": 6}, "stats": {"dist": 2.2, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [2653, 2624], "alt-change": [82, 88], "avg-grade": 1.0, "max-grade": 6.0}},

The first part of the trail heads down the hill with a view on your left, and an old slide after that. The road takes a sharp left turn at the bottom of the hill. At this point, the Jim Slagle Loop Trail is on your left and is an actual designed trail instead of the logging road. If you decide to stay on the logging road, continue north as the trail/road travels through a 20-year-old logged-over area. There are lots of hardwoods, young Douglas fir, and cedars. You pass an old failed beaver pond where a culvert crosses under the road.

The trail starts at the intersection with the Upper Sandy River Trail (an old logging road) and the Jim Slagle Loop Trail (constructed in 2015). Before the trail drops to the river, there is a short spur to a viewpoint that shows a small waterfall and the Sandy River beyond. Please do not cut switchbacks that descend to the river as this trail is difficult to maintain and easily eroded. Cutting switchbacks channels the rainfall into the switchbacks and erodes the entire hillside, so stay on the path!  \r\n\nOnce you reach the Sandy River, you may see some fishermen and women. Cedar Creek flows into the main channel just upstream. There is a fish hatchery further up Cedar Creek, which makes this confluence a popular destination for returning spawning salmon and folks fishing and fish-watching in the fall. A separate trail comes down to this point from the fish hatchery. The trail peters out at the river, but a fishing trail leads downstream. Be careful, as these trails are not designed or maintained and can be unstable and adjacent to fast-moving water. The ice cold Sandy River makes an \"oxbow\" (u shaped) turn just downstream. This causes fast, changing currents as well as large log debris jams.  \r\n\nUnfortunately, some fishermen leave fishing line, hooks, beer bottles, and trash. Pack a trash bag to pack some out, and you can call yourself and your kids a Sandy River Eco-Helper! Please keep your dogs on a leash and give some clearance to fishermen trying to cast a line.  \r\n\nThis trail is a good place to come see salmon spawning in the fall in Cedar Creek. After a good rain that brings the creek levels up, the salmon can be easily seen laying eggs in redds, or fighting each other to fertilize the eggs. There are also some spent dead salmon on the river bank that can attract bears and other wildlife, so keep an eye out and do not let your dog get anywhere near the carcasses if you don't want an emergency veterinarian trip.\r\n\nOnce you head back up the trail, I recommend taking the Jim Slagle Loop Trail to return. It is amazing to have such a gem of a destination so close to Sandy. For a famous photo op to memorialize your trip, head a half mile down Bluff Road to take your picture at the Jonsrud Viewpoint where you can see your Sandy River destination, Mt. Hood, Mt. Adams, the Bull Run Watershed, and the Devil's Backbone, which is part of the Oregon Trail.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Spring \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7034536/this-is-the-largest-tree-around-for-miles-the-western-red-cedar-has-a-bee-hive-w", "ratings": {"rating": 4.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 0.3, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [442, 372], "alt-change": [1, 70], "avg-grade": 4.0, "max-grade": 15.0}},

One of Sandy's secret gems, this trail is much less steep or rocky than the Upper Sandy River Trail, which is an old logging road. It was designed by a famous Northwest trail designer (and local Sandy resident!) Jim Slagle. This was the last trail he designed before his retirement after 40+ years of trail design including Sandy's other gem, Tickle Creek Trail and most of the trails in the Mt. St. Helens Monument. The local youth corps AntFarm worked with local trail builder Gene Tilgner to construct the trail in 2015.\r\n\nThe trail starts where the Upper Sandy River Trail descends and takes a sharp left (north). Take a sharper left and head northwest onto the trail. The first section of trail was an older section of trail that was repaired. There is a large nurse stump with a tree growing out of it and then a small creek. Continue north and cross over a large culvert that is another small tributary to the Sandy River. The trail then heads east and, at a large cedar snag, there is an intersection. The Jim Slagle Loop turns to the left, and going straight ahead is the short Sandy River Midway Trail that takes you back to the logging road (Upper Sandy River Trail). From here, turn left (north). The trail crosses another small creek before coming out to a viewpoint over the river. Along this section of trail is a very large bigleaf maple tree that shades a handy snack or lunch stop.\r\n\nThe trail then gets into thicker cedar forests with a steep side slope. Trailside ferns and \"pistol-butted\" trees grow out of the slopes demonstrating the occasional landslides and loose soil. The trail drops down into an open wet area and crosses a boardwalk/bridge made from parts of the old fallen cedar tree next to the trail. There is private land adjacent to this spot, so please stay on the trail.\r\n\nAcross the boardwalk, the trail takes a sharp right and heads east. You then come to a dense second-growth western red cedar thicket located above the audible Sandy River. The trail then leads you to the largest tree (western red cedar) around, which makes a great photo op! Continue to its end at the intersection with the Upper and Lower Sandy River Trail.  Take a left to head to the river or a right to head back up toward town. I recommend the river and returning on the Jim Slagle Loop the way you came. Shorter loops or figure-eights can be made with the Sandy River and Midway Trails.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Spring \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7034536/this-is-the-largest-tree-around-for-miles-the-western-red-cedar-has-a-bee-hive-w", "ratings": {"rating": 4.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 1.0, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [704, 444], "alt-change": [15, 275], "avg-grade": 6.0, "max-grade": 14.0}},

The hike from this trails northern trailhead traverses some of the oldest and largest forest groves within the wilderness. The trailhead is located on a high ridge making for a fairly level and easy first mile. The trail snakes around towering firs, spruces and hemlocks, some with diameters exceeding seven feet. \r\n\nMassive ferns cover the forest floor, and moss hangs from the 400-year-old trees. The path is well-maintained along the ridge but just past mile 2, the trail turns downhill where it begins a steep, switchback descent toward Drift Creek. Towards the end of the creek feel free to go fishing for salmon or trout before heading back along the path. The trail leads into Horse Lake Trail (continuation of Horse Creek).\r\n\nFrom McKenzie Bridge, OR, you travel south on Horse Creek Rd which becomes dirt road NF 2638. The trailhead is located right off this road and is well marked.\r\n\nThe trail begins with a quick descent to Horse Creek which crosses it via a log bridge. You're then on to a constant uphill climb through nothing but forest, and I do mean nothing else. No clearings, no features, no views, just forest. In time, you come to a series of three switchbacks which lead up and away from the water.\r\n\nEventually, you come to a spot where you cross a narrow creek with no means to cross other than get your feet wet, or go slightly left and make a little jump over. As you continue on you're still heading uphill until you eventually come to another small creek crossing. This one is easily traversed with some zigzagged logs in the water. TURN BACK NOW! \n\nThe trail at this point flattens out considerably which was a welcome sight, BUT, the trail now follows a slow-moving and downright stagnant stream for miles. This section of the hike I dubbed \"Mosquito Alley.\" Swarms of mosquitos attacked us like we had pissed them off intentionally. We eventually came away from Mosquito Alley at the point where the trail intersects with the Separation Lake Trail, but my arms are now covered with at least 100 red welts. If you dare traverse this trail, be sure and slather yourself in deet. We did this on the way back and although we were still swarmed, they mostly left us alone.\r\n\nJust under two miles the Separation Lake Trail, you'll encounter the cutoffs for Water Holes Trail and Nash Lake Trail. There is LITERALLY nothing to look at except trees. The trail was becoming less and less defined by this time. We stopped at 8 miles in. The next day we hiked another 2 miles before we lost the trail completely. We literally ran out of trail. \r\n\nOverall, major disappointment.

Their design, way back in the 1970s, included fences to keep free-roaming cattle from reaching the lake. The Corps built a road - the Witcome Stock Driveway - behind one of these fences so they could collect and remove errant cows.  \r\n\nIn the intervening years, the need to collect stray cows has gone away and today this driveway is more singletrack trail than road.  It shows on today's Forest Service maps as a trail running south of and parallel to the Payette Trail #970 between the trailheads at Payette and Manzanita.\r\n\nThe east end of the Witcome is accessed from the Payette Trailhead. After crossing the bridge, but before going through the fence leading to the Payette Trail #970, you'll see an old road going uphill. It will have a barbed wire fence running along it.  \r\n\nAbout two hundred feet uphill, both the road and the fence will drop down to the west (right). This is the old stock driveway. Just follow this old road, keeping the fence on your right, until it joins the Payette Trail #970 just below the trailhead at Manzanita. To reach the Witcome's west end, you'll have to descend a short distance from that trailhead.\r\n\nThere are some springs (but no potable water) and fern gardens along this route, a few views of the surrounding hills and Applegate Lake, and forests of madrones and pines.

A hike through an open meadow is followed by a plunge into a dense Ponderosa forest within a hundred yards. This forest passages provide cool relief if you hike this in summer.\r\n\nAbout 8 miles from the PCT, the trail drops to its low point along an unnamed creek.

Turn right and hike ~mile and another 500 feet of gain to get to the watchtower. You can make a very nice ~7.5 mile loop by returning via the Mother Lode Trail #558 to Pansy Creek Trail #551 (Pansy Lake is also nicer than Dickey Lake).", "features": "Commonly Backpacked \u00b7 Lake", "condition": "Unknown"}, "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 1.3, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [4954, 3901], "alt-change": [1057, 4], "avg-grade": 16.0, "max-grade": 58.0}},

Sometimes the light breaks through more than other times, but for the most part it is very well-shaded and the trail is well-maintained, although it can get rocky and rooty in places. \r\n\nAfter getting out of the Cliff Creek drainage, you reach the end of a ridge close to the ocean where you can hear the bellowing of sea lions below, and then you drop back into another drainage (the Chitwood Creek drainage). As the trail nears Chitwood Creek, it becomes a bit more disheveled as the water has obviously taken its toll on the trail, but it's still in pretty good shape. There are some little parts that require scrambling over a large rock or a stump but for the most part it's all doable and soon enough the trail leaves the creek area anyway, and turns back into a nice, dry trail amidst the forest. \r\n\nJust under 2.5 miles in, the trail breaks out of the forest onto a large, steep meadow with incredible views of the ocean, and at this point you can finally see the sea lions you could hear in the forest previously, as they are all generally sitting out on the rocks in the ocean below the visible ridge to the south.

At this point, the trail contours around until it reaches a small ridge, where you can get some amazing views of the Salmon River Estuary and some cool surrounding rock formations. \r\n\nAt this point, the trail starts to climb up some steep switchbacks until it reaches the top of the ridge, at which point the trail mostly levels out for the rest of its length. There are some slight ups and downs as the trail crosses back into and goes through the forest, but for the most part the elevation gain gets finished in the first 2 miles of the trail. \r\n\nAfter crossing back into the forest, the trail gets a little bit wider and can sometimes get boggy in places but overall is an enjoyable trail with cool views of moss covered trees until the trail reaches its end at the National Forest Development Road 1861, where there is another trail sign and some information about the area.", "features": "Views", "condition": "All Clear"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7048995/looking-up-the-salmon-river-from-the-usgs-survey-marker-on-the-top", "ratings": {"rating": 4.6, "num_reviewers": 7}, "stats": {"dist": 3.4, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [1270, 16], "alt-change": [1345, 93], "avg-grade": 8.0, "max-grade": 31.0}},

It passes a junction with the Post Camp Trail #467 about 6.7 miles from Forest Road 2710, the Badger Creek Cutoff Trail #477 at 7.5 miles, and one with the Gumjuwac Trail #480 at 8.6 miles up from the road.  These junctions provide opportunities for loops or backpacks or trips using a car shuttle between trailheads.\r\n\nYou reach Badger Lake and the Badger Lake Campground at 10.6 miles.

The next section of the trail up to to the first summit is all on steep loose scree. The trail can be hard to follow here, but just head up to the top of the peak while trying to avoid any rock slides. From the top of the first peak, most of the elevation is complete. From there, you walk along the ridge to Diamond Peak. The trail can be a little technical at times, but it is certainly doable. Be sure to be extra careful you don't send any rocks down the side of the mountain as they pick up speed fast.\r\n\nThe view from the top is amazing, with views on all sides of the surrounding wilderness.

We took a photo of the wooden map at the boat launch, which helped with navigation. The first 2 miles pass through a burn zone on the north side of the lake, and then traverses the headwaters of the Willamette River (central fork). \r\n\nAfter passing through some beautiful forests with views of the lake and then some scree zones, you settle into a gently undulating trail for the rest of the trip. It's about 13 miles from North Waldo to Shadow Bay moving counter-clockwise, and then about 8 miles from Shadow Bay Campground to North Waldo as you continue on. There are lots of huckleberries to be had in August, but few opportunities for water - either bring plenty or consider purification of lake water (which is already considered \"safe to drink\" but use a steri-pen or filter to be sure).

At 0.6 miles, you'll pass Emma Lake, and at roughly one mile, you'll enter the burn zone of the 1996 Charlton Fire. The area has been very slow to recover and dead, bare trees still stand. Trail maintenance is done periodically to keep the trail open, but do not be surprised if you have to scramble over, under, or around fallen trees. \r\n\nAt 1.4 miles from the trailhead, you'll reach a junction with the Whig & Torrey Way Trail #3581 and Wahanna Lake. Just past Wahanna Lake is a short (0.3 mile), steep side-trail down to Harvey Lake. At mile three, you reach Lake Kiwa and a junction with the Rigdon Lakes Trail #3555. Continuing south, you pass Rigdon Butte to the west, and, at six miles, you cross the outlet of Waldo Lake, the headwaters of the North Fork of the Middle Fork of the Willamette River. This is also where you leave the burn zone and re-enter the forest.\r\n\nContinuing southwest, the Whana Trail #3583 overlaps the  Jim Weaver Loop Trail (Waldo Lake Trail) #3590 for less than 0.25 miles beyond the outlet, then it veers west to pass Lake Chetlo and end at the Salmon Lakes Trail #3585.", "features": "Commonly Backpacked \u00b7 Lake \u00b7 Swimming \u00b7 Wildflowers", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7042409/lake-chetlo", "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 6.7, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [5422, 5179], "alt-change": [752, 546], "avg-grade": 4.0, "max-grade": 14.0}},

Parking is limited at both ends. The dirt roads leading to either side should be passable by any vehicle. This version is mapped from west to east. \r\n\nFrom the west end of the trail you'll set off through a plantation before the trail takes a quick switchback to the left/north. Enough people have missed this turn that there is a very well-worn trail leading 50 feet or so to a rock where it obviously ends. You'll cross a bridge over a small creek and a second bridge over a larger creek before Santiam River comes into view. The next section of the trail has great views of the river and impressive rapids. \r\n\nYou'll soon come to another creek crossing that lacks a bridge and can be precarious when the water is high. Triple Falls is only a short distance after the creek - a suitable reward. Triple Falls is very impressive with high water, but obscured by trees. There's a great campsite here too. \r\n\nAfter Triple Falls the trail leaves the river and climbs over 400 feet. There are two good viewpoints near the top of this ascent from which you can see Henline Mountain and Santiam River far below. The trail then descends about 400 feet and returns to the edge of Santiam River. You'll cross two more creeks: one with large logs that make crossing easy and the other small enough to not cause problems. \r\n\nThe next feature is Three Pools, a very popular set of swimming holes. Three Pools Day Use Area is across the river offering much easier access than this trail (and hence it can be quite crowded in summer). \r\n\nThe trail continues to follow Santiam River the remaining ~one mile to the east trailhead without any significant elevation changes and only one more notable creek crossing.", "features": "River/Creek \u00b7 Swimming \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Waterfall \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7066465/henline-mountain-from-a-view-point-near-the-highest-part-of-the-trail", "ratings": {"rating": 4.5, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 4.1, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [1783, 1195], "alt-change": [871, 665], "avg-grade": 7.0, "max-grade": 42.0}},

Visitors must have a day use pass to park at the site. Proceed past the entrance booth for .5 miles and turn into the first parking area on your left. Once parked, head over the large bridge over Salmon River towards the wetlands trails. Cross over the bridge and pass by the trail fork on your left. Going straight puts you on a loop with the Wetlands Trail on your left and the Foot Trail on your right. Take either one and they both lead to the turnoff for the Boulder Ridge Trail which then crosses a footbridge over Sixes Creek. \r\n\nOnce on the Boulder Ridge Trail, it begins a heart pumping climb up one of many switchbacks, then dipping into  another drainage, crossing a couple of creeks and coming to a viewpoint. There was significant blow down on this trail that has been recently cleared. Continue climbing, and recross one of the creeks higher on the hill and soon the trail turns into an old logging road bed. \r\n\nFollow the old road bed for awhile, and then the trail starts a long, steady climb to the ridge top. There is a short user trail on your left that takes you out to a viewpoint of Mt. Hood. The trail skirts just below the ridge line of Huckleberry Mountain before finally topping out and heading east towards the true summit of Huckleberry Mountain and meeting up with the Plaza Trail #783 that continues on the Huckleberry Mountain ridge top.\r\n\nBoulder Ridge is a fairly steep trail and there are sections that are narrow with drop offs. The blowdown along the trail has been cut out, but more blow down is possible and that affects trail tread width. For the best views, visitors should continue on past the junction with Plaza Trail #783 to the open areas on the ridgetop. This trail receives relatively little use and those who make it to the top of Huckleberry Mountain are rewarded with awesome views of Mt. Hood, Mt. Adams, Lolo Pass, Hunchback Mountain and the Salmon-Huckleberry Wilderness.", "features": "Fall Colors \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7022546/mt-hood-from-boulder-ridge-trail-on-huckleberry-mt-photo-by-david-brown", "ratings": {"rating": 4.3, "num_reviewers": 4}, "stats": {"dist": 4.2, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [3796, 1183], "alt-change": [2613, 22], "avg-grade": 12.0, "max-grade": 44.0}},
