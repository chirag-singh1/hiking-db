There are very pleasant sections of this trail and some that you just have to get through. This is an inner city hike, connecting various parks and natural areas with some city street hiking required but much of it is on dirt paths and in the woods. The trail is poorly marked in areas so be sure you have the map and a GPS or you'll get turned around. Trail is marked with, intermittently and somewhat unreliably, with blue diamond markers and sometimes with blue blazes. There are sections that are newly marked (2019) and some that have not seen maintenance in a long while. The \"official map\" does not follow the blazes in areas. \r\n\nSection 1 of 4\r\nPark a car on Grove St. at Oak Barrel Tavern, but in the back of their lot, and drive back to the start. Parking is on the roadside next to Quinsigamond Lake. The start is a little rough (trashy) but it is mostly well marked with a few places that are confusing.\r\n\nSection 2 of 4\r\nThere is a parking lot at Coe's Pond, drop a car there and go to Grove St. to do this section. On this part, there are intersecting trails with confusingly similar markings particularly on Newton Hill where all six paths seem to have a diamond marker with different colors that are very faded and through Hadwen Arboretum Trail where the trees seem to be marked with blue blazes that have nothing to do with the East West Trail. There must be some reason for this but the markers have either been prohibited or mostly removed from some sections that are along roadways. Coe's Pond is particularly pretty and if you haven't been to the impressive Bancroft Tower, it's right along the trail.\r\n\nSection 3 of 4\r\nPark a car at Boynton Park and go back to Coe's Pond. You'll hike through several remarkable parks but the start of the hike is right down Mill St which is very sad since there appear to be better options (God's Acre). You do go through a corner of Tetasset which is lovely and hilly. Once you're on the path that is near the airport, you have to pay extremely close attention (use GPS) as the markers are rare and there appear to be and old and new version of this path here, it is also possible that someone removed some of the markers.  \r\n\nSection 4 of 4 \r\nCascades Parking on Olean St. to Boynton Park (the unofficial leash free dog park of the city). Leash free dogs are not technically legal here (signs posted and fees are noted) but most everyone ignores them. As a former dog owner, I get the appeal of this but if you're not a dog person you should be warned.

The Mountain Bike Loop also makes for a slightly more intuitive, more confident loop in less-than-ideal conditions such as in the dark or in a rain storm.\r\n\nAt the end of the day, if you're hiking on the Mountain Bike Loop, you're not pounding pavement; and that in itself can be a great success and can bring your passion for hiking to new levels.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7067202/snowy-wood", "ratings": {"rating": 3.8, "num_reviewers": 4}, "stats": {"dist": 6.4, "dist-type": "Loop", "alt-range": [259, 115], "alt-change": [462, 462], "avg-grade": 3.0, "max-grade": 12.0}},

Between the top of the Great Blue Hill and the Park Headquarters it has two branches. For a description of the south branch look at the Skyline Trail South Branch. \r\n\nThe trail starts near the intersection of I95/93. From here its flatter and easier terrain, crossing Green St. Then it goes uphill to the summit of Little Blue Hill and has some roots on the trail. It continues downhill to a Park and Ride. Here you cross Rt138 which has a lot of traffic. Afterwards, the trail gets steep with stone steps, slabs and scrambles. Higher up there are many viewpoints. At the top, it gets flat and you pass a weather observatory and observation tower. It becomes a steep downhill from here with slabs, rocks and stone steps. It crosses another trail and quickly goes up Wolcott Hill, a scramble. The trail continues up and down Hermenway Hill and Hancock Hill, with a few more scrambles and some short flatter sections with viewpoints. The last part down to the park headquarters is steep with slabs and roots. \r\n\nAfter this, cross Hillside St, and follow a carriage road for a short section and quickly turn into the woods. The trail will get steeper uphill to the top of Tucker Hill, with roots and rocks. On the way to the summit of Buck Hill, you'll pass North Boyce Hill and some ups and downs. Buck Hill has an open summit with nice views. The trail will go steeply down with stone steps and roots to Rt28. You cross the busy road and the trail becomes flat and gentle for a while. You'll reach a carriage road but quickly turn left uphill towards Chicktawbut Hill. The sections here are steep with rock scrambling with nice views.\r\n\nYou'll follow a fence for a while and then go up and down smaller hills like Fenna and Nahanton Hill. You'll then cross a big boulder and continue up and down until you reach the less busy Chicktawbut Rd. There are viewpoints and smaller scrambles along the way. The trail gets steeper up Wampatuck Hill and then down again towards Rattlesnake Hill. Here it passes by the left edge of a rock climbing area, scrambling up to the top. There are nice views here. \r\n\nFrom this point, its down and up and you'll pass a water hole with steep cliffs. The trail will be easier here with some roots and cross Wampatuck Rd, another easier crossing.

While the NET ends at the MA/ NH border, the M & M continues to Mount Monadnock. It starts from the MA/ NH border and runs to Green Woods Road. Here, there is a blue-blaze alternate that follows the road east past a historical landmark. \r\n\nIt follows an old road through the woods, then turns onto a newly made singletrack. There are a few trees down in this area. It follows the remainder of Monument Road to come out at Route 119. At 119, the trail turns left to follow it, then turns right onto Old County Road. It turns left off Old County Road at a monolithic stone foundation. At a swampy area, there's a bypass trail on the left that avoids some of the squishy areas.  \r\n\nFrom Old Troy Road, the trail begins climbing the ridgeline of Little Monadnock Mountain. The trail follows the ridge through Rhododendron State Park. The trail follows Prospect Street until it comes out in Troy, at the Railroad Depot. It follows Depot Street, then turns right to follow South Main Street.  Since camping isn't allowed anywhere along this stretch, you may want to look for lodging options somewhere around Troy (if you're doing this as a thru-hike). \r\n\nLeaving Troy, the trail veers left to follow Quarry Road. At the end of Quarry Road, the trail veers right (off the main road) into the woods. It follows this until it merges with Royce Trail. It climbs over the north peak of Gap Mountain, then descends down to the north parking area. It traverses a lemon squeezer of large boulders, then crosses Route 124. It coincides with Royce Trail to the White Arrow Trail, then follows White Arrow Trail to the summit. \r\n\nIf you wish to continue on a longer thru-hike, you can connect to the Monadnock - Sunapee Greenway.  The M - S Greenway will take you another 50 miles north to the summit of Mount Sunapee.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Cave \u00b7 Commonly Backpacked \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 Historical Significance \u00b7 Lake \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7028414/looking-north-at-the-pumpelly-ridgeline-from-the-summit-of-mount-monadnock", "ratings": {"rating": 4.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 18.3, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [3137, 948], "alt-change": [4174, 1984], "avg-grade": 6.0, "max-grade": 63.0}},
