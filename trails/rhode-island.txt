The next .5 mile is on singletrack through marsh grass. The .25 mile that rounds the point is a technical scramble across boulders and medium sized rocks before emerging again onto smooth beach of Watch Hill which is excellent for sunrises and sunsets. \r\n\nTiming your hike wth tidal cycles and seasons makes the hike a bit different each time. The Napatree Conservation Area is a real gem. Be sure to enjoy the osprey, falcons, egrets, herons, a wide variety of shore birds along wth the occasional deer and raccoon.
