As the name would suggest, the main feature of this trail is Eagle Falls, where Eagle Creek falls about 50 feet to the Cumberland River. The trailhead is located on the west side of the river, opposite the main viewing area for Cumberland Falls. There is limited parking at the trailhead, so access can be a challenge during busy summer weekends.  \r\n\nThe trail starts out alongside the Cumberland River above the falls, but quickly starts climbing the cliffs along the side of the river with several beautiful views of Cumberland Falls. The trail can be steep in places, but most of these steep areas have been fitted with stairs to make the climb easier. About 1/3 of a mile from the trailhead, a spur branches off to the left and climbs the hill to a purported viewpoint over the canyon. Unfortunately trees grow quickly, and the view is often blocked by vegetation.  \r\n\nAbout 0.5 miles from the trailhead, the trail splits into the loop portion of the hike. For the quickest access to the falls, follow the trail to the right. To the left, the trail climbs up and over a hill, then down the other side to connect with Eagle Creek. The trail then follows the creek downstream, passing several areas with nice spots for wading or playing in the creek. \r\n\nOnce you reach the mouth of the creek, another trail spur leads to the bottom of the falls. The spur to the falls is a steep hike down the cliff, but again stairs are in place for ease and safety. At the base of the cliff are numerous boulders or sandy areas to sit and enjoy the view. At the base of Eagle Falls is a series of small shallow pools before the water spills into the Cumberland River. Cumberland Falls can again be seen from this area. \r\n\nOn the way back to the trailhead, the trail runs along the side of a cliff in places, but railings are in place to help prevent a fall. This trail is very popular for the views and waterfalls and is heavily traveled during peak season.  The heavy traffic combined with regular maintenance helps guarantee that the trail is well-worn and easy to follow.", "features": "River/Creek \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Waterfall", "condition": "All Clear"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7032610/cumberland-falls-in-the-autumn", "ratings": {"rating": 4.4, "num_reviewers": 14}, "stats": {"dist": 1.5, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [1112, 850], "alt-change": [411, 353], "avg-grade": 9.0, "max-grade": 35.0}},

From end to end Rough Trail packs in more climbing and descending than any other trail in the area. In short, Rough lives up to its name.\r\n\nThe trail is just shy of 8 miles long and traverses the Red River Gorge across its heart from west to east. At the east end the Swift Camp Creek Trail #219  continues into Clifty Wilderness for almost another 7 miles making for a long trail outing of nearly 15 miles one way.\r\n\nRough Trail begins on the western end at the busy Martin's Fork Trailhead. It's used heavily by rock climbers, backpackers, day hikers, and trail runners. From the TH hike back toward Nada Tunnel and cross the road at a footbridge.  Right away the woods are cool and dark and the trail stays tight with the small stream. The 1st Section climbs up Martin's Fork and gains Tunnel Ridge at the end of the Gray's Arch Trail #205.\r\n\nFrom the intersection with Gray's Arch Trail Rough continues on toward Gray's Arch itself through its 2nd Section, first continuing out a broad, flat ridge before dropping steeply down a newly cut section of trail and then some steep stairs. At the bottom of the stairs run or walk a few yards to the right for a fantastic view of Gray's Arch before turning around and continuing east on Rough Trail. The trail continues down into the deep valley and immediately begins climbing up to Rush Ridge. The 2nd Section ends when the trail levels out on top.\r\n\nThe 3rd Section immediately drops steeply over a rock step from the crest of the ridge and then passes under an overhanging section of cliff and then into a narrow slot canyon for a short distance before coming out on a steep and thickly vegetated slope that drops down and down and down to Rush Branch. Again, Rough Trail begins climbing steeply as soon as it hits bottom. The 3rd Section ends with the 3rd climb along the trail as Rough Trail intersects the Sheltowee Trace on Pinch Em Tight Ridge.\r\n\nOnce on top of the ridge the first real reprieve comes as Rough Trail runs with the Sheltowee Trace straight out the ridge for about a mile before beginning another brutal descent. In the valley, the trails cross two creeks in quick succession before splitting. The Sheltowee heads north and Rough continues east, once again beginning a lung-burning climb out of Chimney Top Creek to gain Chimney Top Rd.\r\n\nAt the beginning of the 5th section is another respite before the descent into Parch Corn Creek.

However, it the water is over the blocks you can do a brief detour to get around it. \r\n\nFor the first 1/4 mile you be mostly out in the open fields that offer great views of local flora and fauna.

There is no parking at either end. The trail can be accessed from Section 24 or near its southern end at The Narrows Road.\r\n\nAccessing Section 25 from Section 24: \nThere is a parking lot on Bridge Rock Road approximately 1/4 mile south of Pine Creek Church. It is intended for horse trailers. So, the trail heading south, which leads to Sinking Creek (the start of Section 25), is shared with horses and ATV's. It has steep climbs and rocky trail tread. The suspension bridge over Sinking Creek is the start of Section 25. A better hike is to go north from the horse parking lot on the gravel road following the Sheltowee blazes. Look for the trail to enter the woods on the right approximately 0.8 mi from the horse parking lot. This is very nice trail which is the southern end of Section 24.\r\n\nAccessing Section 25 from near its southern end: \nThere is an area for one or two cars where the trail re-enters the woods from The Narrows Road. Hike north on the gravel road for approximately 1/2 mile and the Sheltowee markers will be on the left. Continuing north, the trail is quite nice for approximately 4.5 miles up to the second gravel road crossing (Pond Ridge Rd). The gradual elevation change combined with very little horse and motorized vehicle use makes this surprisingly pleasant.\r\n\nSection 25 south of The Narrows Road gets lots of bicycle use. They come from Laurel River Lake (Section 26) and hike north to Section 25 and turn around at The Narrows Road.\r\n\nOne of the must-see features of Section 25 is the suspension bridge over Sinking Creek. However, it is at the north end on the multi-use trail as described above. Though you are not likely to see another human being on the trail, they do not tread lightly when they are there. The aftermath makes the north end of Section 25 quite rough.\r\n\nThe preferred route for hiking Section 25 is starting on Section 26 at the Laurel River Lake parking lot at the intersection of KY 192 and KY 1193. Hike north to Pond Ridge Rd as described above. Beyond that point is where multi-use becomes apparent. Turn around for an out-and-back hike. On your way back, there is an option to take Rockcastle Narrows East Trail #401, which is very scenic along Rockcastle River.", "features": "River/Creek \u00b7 Waterfall", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7014624/from-behind-van-hook-waterfall", "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 9.8, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [1318, 894], "alt-change": [735, 1003], "avg-grade": 3.0, "max-grade": 24.0}},

The difficulty level varies widely, so it is broken into three sections:  Section 26 North, Section 26, and Section 26 South.  This map is for Section 26 South which is vastly different than the preceding portions along Laurel River Lake and Cane Creek. The elevation change, technical features, and narrow trail make it more challenging.\r\n\nThere is a large paved parking lot at the south end of the Laurel River Lake Dam with permanent restrooms and shelter house. Hike south on Highway 1193. The beach will be on your left and the spillway on your right. The entrance to the trail is difficult to find. It is hidden behind the guardrail immediately south of the spillway on the spillway side of the road. Step over the guard rail and head into the woods, and you'll see a trail sign. From there to the end there are no intersections along the trail, so you can't get lost.  \r\n\nThe trail quickly gets narrow, but then enters onto an old fire road. It's smooth and rolling for a while, but don't let that fool you, it gets rugged quickly. If you had trouble navigating any portion of the trail by this point, this would be a good place to turn around. The rest is rocky with a tricky creek crossing and good scenery along the way. When you reach the boat ramp, that is the end of Section 26.
