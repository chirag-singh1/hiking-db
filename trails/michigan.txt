Much of the path leads through forested areas, and is well marked and easy to follow. There are segments on the exposed rock ridges marked by cairns. Some of the ridges have some challenging climbs.

There is also some shelter at the mine if the weather is bad. \r\n\nContinuing on, the next segment is fairly easy. There are a few short challenging climbs, but the day is not too strenuous. The descent into Little Todd Harbor is quite steep. The trail crosses some marshy lowlands on the approach to Little Todd Harbor. Be prepared for soggy socks! There is also a very challenging log crossing. Trekking poles are a near necessity here. \r\n\nThe section of trail to North Lake Desor is shorter but the  demand is significantly higher. Do not under-estimate the challenge of this short day. There are several sections of tough ascents with technical scrambling. This segment also provides some of the first great views of Isle Royale and Lake Superior from the ridge. \r\n\nThis final stretch is nearly 12 miles with a net descent making the going a bit easier. That being said, the trail does have quite a few ups and downs so don't expect this section to be easy. Some of the uphills to the ridges are steep, and there are some sections where the trail can be a bit overgrown.

There are blazes throughout the trail and posted maps and directional arrows where the trail intersects with other snowshoe or cross-country ski trails. It is important to avoid cross-country ski trails while wearing snowshoes as the crampons will tear up the groomed track. \r\n\nThis trail is mostly flat track with a single lane and only gently rolling elevations. Fallen trees and debris are usually removed from the trail, but there is always the possibility of small trees or brush due to heavy snow or ice. Snow is not cleared from trails; be aware that even with snowshoes hiking through deep snow can be arduous. It is always colder near the lakeshore, so plan for temperatures several degrees colder, strong winds, and lake effect snowfall. \r\n\nAround the half-way point Lost Lake comes into view, with the rising dunes of Lake Michigan beyond its shore. The lake is usually snow-covered so be extremely careful approaching the edges, as it is difficult to see where they actually begin to drop off into the water. * DO NOT attempt to hike/snowshoe/ski across the lake. *\r\n\nThe end of the trail meanders around the luge track, where beginner luge classes take place. There is also a warming yurt and fire pit near the track, but hours of operation vary. Finally, the trail ends back at the lodge and ice rinks where there is an indoor fireplace, benches, restrooms, warm beverages, and snacks. \r\n\nThe cross-country ski trails are groomed and well lit at night (usually 10 p.m. cut off; check at lodge to be sure), but portions of the snowshoe trails go through pine forest, which is not lit or groomed.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Fall Colors", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7062061/quick-day-out-to-lost-lake-on-the-cross-country-skiing-trails", "ratings": {"rating": 4.7, "num_reviewers": 3}, "stats": {"dist": 2.6, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [699, 613], "alt-change": [233, 246], "avg-grade": 3.0, "max-grade": 19.0}},

There is a nice bridge crossing the river and much of the trail has views of the river. The American beech, sugar maples and tulip poplar trees exceed 100 feet in height and over 5 feet in diameter. In the summer, the canopy can block out almost all the sunlight creating a great shady outing. \r\n\nWear adequate footwear. Most of the trail surface is packed dirt with leaf litter. In the flood plain, it can be quite muddy or even impassible with standing water from the Galien River.\r\n\nThe trailhead at the parking lot is well marked. The trail itself does not have markers, but this is not an issue as the trail is easy to follow. The first third of a mile is a wide path that winds through the forest. The trees get larger and larger as you approach the Galien River overlook. There are interpretive signs and benches at the overlook. There is a commanding view of the river and the old growth forest. The trail continues down a set of stairs and across the bridge. Stay left and the trail will enter the flood plain. You are now away from the river as you weave through vernal wetlands.\r\n\nNext, the trail will climb up onto high country. At the trail junction (which is unmarked), stay left. The forest is massive with with an airy understory. The trail widens again into an easy path. The Galien River is on your right. The path ends at the northern boundary.\r\n\nThe 311-acre Warren Woods State Park is a hidden gem in dunes country. This little-known park contains some of the last old growth trees in the region. While most visitors go to its sister park on Lake Michigan, Warren Dunes State Park, Warren Woods is worth seeking out. \r\n\nE.K. Warren purchased the land in 1879. He was originally going to harvest the trees but changed his mind. This is the only climax beech maple forest remaining in the state of Michigan. E.K. Warren is the inventor of the feather bone corset. \r\n\nWarren Woods was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1967.\r\n\nFor more information, visit the Michigan DNR's website for Warren Woods.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7012131/walking-through-the-forest", "ratings": {"rating": 5.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 0.7, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [653, 639], "alt-change": [18, 19], "avg-grade": 1.0, "max-grade": 3.0}},

North Manitou Island is part of the National Park Service's Sleeping Bear National Lakeshore. The island is almost entirely covered in forests but offers incredible views of Lake Michigan from the shoreline. The water of Lake Michigan is insanely clear at this latitude and provides for great sunrises and sunsets. Mosquitoes and flies can be bad during parts of the year, so plan accordingly. \r\n\nThe main trails are clearly marked and the footing good with packed dirt and gravel. The trails are wide and were once roads or logging rail lines. The secondary and \"historic\" trails are not being maintained and are becoming hard to follow and are clogged with downed trees. I wish the NPS would maintain these trails as most people that come to the island want solitude and these trails would better distribute backpackers.\r\n\nThe classic trail is typically done in three days, with one night spent at the south end of the island and one night at the north end. The trail grade is easy with the only moderate pull being the \"Old Grade\" which is in the northwest section of the island. The trail has a 1.5 mile stretch of 5-6% grade that runs uphill from south to north. Camping close Lake Michigan is preferred as there is easy access to water and great views. Fredrickson Place and Crescent City are excellent camping areas on the southwest side of the island. On the southeast side, the area around the cemetery has good campsites.\r\n\nCamping at the north end of the island is more difficult as there are very steep bluffs that prevent access to the water. Even without a pack, it can be sketchy to get down to the water and back. There is not 300' of clearance to allow camping at the base of the bluffs. Plan ahead and bring water.\r\n\nLake Manitou, a lake within the island, offers great fishing but be aware that you'll get a really bad case of swimmer's itch if you wade into the lake. Please Google \"swimmers itch\" if you are not aware of this medical condition caused by parasites in the water (please note that you'll not get swimmer's itch in Lake Michigan). The lake does provide ample water to filter and excellent fishing. Many camp along its eastern shore.\r\n\nThe island does have a small campground.

You are among the first to explore this new trail and we hope you enjoy hiking it as much as we enjoyed building it!

It winds five miles through varied ecosystems, allowing the hiker a broad sampling of the natural diversity within the park.  It begins with a section along the beginning of the \"natural rivers\" section of the Huron River.  It then crosses a meadow and winds through the woods before emerging at Trout Lake, which it circles before following a trail that leads away from the lake.  A little way down this trail, it bears right back into a beautiful woods, through which the hiker experiences subtle shifts in the ecosystem several times.  After crossing the paved bike trails, it follows the contours of Kent Lake before emerging near the beach, which the visitor then follows back to the trailhead.\r\n\nThere are many opportunities to create a shorter route if desired, as the trail intersects the park's paved path several times, and anyone may choose to go around Trout Lake or pay it only a brief visit before dropping back into the woods.\r\n\nThis trail remains under development and we would appreciate your feedback and ideas, especially related to potential interpretive  displays or information.\r\n\nPlease contact Tony Pitts at trails@islandlakefriends.org", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 Lake \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Spring \u00b7 Swimming \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7024832/emerging-from-the-woods-toward-trout-lake", "ratings": {"rating": 4.3, "num_reviewers": 18}, "stats": {"dist": 5.1, "dist-type": "Loop", "alt-range": [944, 881], "alt-change": [163, 162], "avg-grade": 1.0, "max-grade": 8.0}},

See some of the trail photos for help telling which paths belong to the trail at various junctions.\r\n\nAs a warning, the managers at the Metropark seem to be making a change in how they label their trails. If you look at the maps online and at the older signs at some junctions, the Chickadee Trail is considered only a part of the trail mapped here, and the return loop goes down a different path entirely. However, new signs have been added at the parking lot and at every junction in the nature trail area, with 4 overlapping trail loops rather than several single-named trail sections.  \r\n\nThe Chickadee Trail shown here represents the new trail, which matches the newest junction signs you'll see while hiking along the trail. Because of the changes in the trail labeling, the old signs can be very confusing; the new trail goes along what the old signs label as the Fox Trail, along the east side of the loop, and one of the legs of the old Chickadee Loop has been relabeled as a shortcut instead.

At times, the path is right on the water's edge and offers beautiful views of the large lake and the many islands within it. At other points, the pathway meanders through meadows and forests offering chances to see deer (of which Kensington Metropark has too many) and other animals. Parts are hilly and parts are flat. This variety makes it an excellent trail for biking, long-distance running, or just a quick stroll along any section.\r\n\nThis is a loop trail with many parking areas/access points along its length, so there isn't a clear beginning or end. As such, this description uses Maple Beach as a start point (a spot with abundant parking) and is described going clockwise from there. \r\n\nThe region to the north of Maple Beach is the hilliest along the trail and is relatively steep by SE Michigan bike path standards. This section heads away from the lake through large meadows with some sports fields and a swampy region along Maple Beach Drive. \r\n\nAt the northern end, you can access the Farm Center before the trail crosses the Huron River along West Buno Road (separated by a guardrail). At the northeasternmost part of the trail, you can pick up the Milford Trail. The northeast section of the trail mostly keeps its distance from Kent Lake, passing in and out of forest while traveling parallel to Huron River Parkway. This section has some enjoyable rolling hills. A long but gently graded section takes you past the Martindale Beach parking area with access to the disc golf course. \r\n\nThe southern section of the trail descends along the inland side of the East Boat Launch to the water's edge, but unfortunately also the edge of the I-96 exit ramp. This part can be a bit noisy due to the highway, but it offers great views of the lake. Part of it crosses the Huron River on its own bridge under I-96. \r\n\nThe west section of the trail is along the lake, relatively flat, and offers connections to the West Boat Ramp and Nature Center. You'll get some beautiful views of the lake here. Part of this section is between the golf course and the lake so the noise from I-96 will dissipate quickly.  \r\n\nAfter the Nature Center, the trail follows Maple Beach Drive through forests. This section has many small rolling hills. You'll soon pass the Boat Rental and return to Maple Beach.", "features": "Fall Colors \u00b7 Lake \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Swimming \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7034781/the-heron-rookery-in-winter-on-wildwing-lake", "ratings": {"rating": 4.3, "num_reviewers": 6}, "stats": {"dist": 8.8, "dist-type": "Loop", "alt-range": [940, 883], "alt-change": [206, 206], "avg-grade": 1.0, "max-grade": 8.0}},
