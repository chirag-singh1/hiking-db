You'll always see plenty of hikers as well as horses, trail runners, dog walkers, and mountain bikers.\r\n\nThe Pine Trail is an orange-blazed loop that encircles the Mountain Laurel Trail and Oak Trail on the south side of Allaire State Park. From time to time the three individual trails share the same corridor, so keep your eyes on the blazes. The park is full of unmarked trails, which can get confusing. They are well traveled and appear as well maintained as the official trail. If you get off track, you'll always find your way back. \r\n\nYou'll find the trailhead for the Pine Trail on the west side of the parking lot. After crossing the dirt road, bear left to follow the trail in a clockwise direction.The surface is sandy, primarily packed with beach rock but there are some softer areas.

Childs Park Trail to see nearly all the classic features Delaware Water Gap has to offer in one location. Be sure to leave yourself plenty of time to enjoy this trail's lush forests and soothing cascades, as you'll surely wish you had more once you experience them firsthand.\r\n\nStarting at the George W. Childs Park Main Parking Area, take the Parking Connector a short distance to the first junction with the George W. Childs Park Trail. Head right at this junction, descending gently until you reach your first of three large waterfalls along the journey: Factory Falls. \r\n\nFrom 1823 to 1832, Factory Falls served as the power plant for a lively woolen mill. In its day, a woolen mill in a rural area was a rarity. Usually, woolen mills were only operated in large cities, where wool could be brought in from surrounding farms to be processed and eventually crafted into clothing. \r\n\nContinuing on the trail from Factory Falls, keep descending (rather steeply in sections) through a densely wooded ravine to the second of three waterfalls: Fulmer Falls. \r\n\nForward in time from the days of the woolen mill at Factory Falls, this area saw yet another period of construction during the New Deal. During that time, the Civilian Conservation Core built a beautiful pavilion and picnic area along the turbulent pools at the bottom of Fulmer Falls. While their handiwork is no longer around for use today, the crumbling remains of these features can still be seen. \r\n\nAfter lingering at Fulmer Falls, follow the trail down a few sets of stairs to the last waterfall: Deer Leap Falls. \r\n\nFalling over 30 feet to the waters below, Deer Leap Falls is a great place to find a nearby rock to sit on and enjoy your lunch as you enjoy its cascading, frothy waters. While it's prohibited to swim here, this is the ideal spot to take off your shoes and cool your feet on a hot day.\r\n\nWhen you're ready to depart from Deer Leap Falls, hop back on the trail and continue descending for a short time before crossing a bridge over Dingmans Creek and ascending the more gently graded path back to the parking area.", "features": "Fall Colors \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Waterfall", "condition": "Unknown"}, "ratings": {"rating": 4.2, "num_reviewers": 5}, "stats": {"dist": 0.8, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [939, 778], "alt-change": [152, 169], "avg-grade": 7.0, "max-grade": 25.0}},

Cliff Trail is a moderately used doubletrack trail from Raymondskill Road to the Milfor Knob Overlook. It mostly keeps the hiker a safe distance from the ledge, and only meanders close enough to key overlook locations where people can safely stand behind wooden railings.\r\n\nConversely, this trail (Cliff Park Trail) is not marked in any way but is much more rewarding with its views. It parallels Cliff Trail almost in its entirety, and even joins Cliff Trail in a few sections. It provides the hiker almost constant views but is dangerous if one is not careful. In no portion is it closer than three feet to the edge of a cliff, but that is certainly close enough.\r\n\nPark at the Hackers Parking Lot and the trailhead will be across Raymondskill Road. There are multiple unmarked side trails in this area, and I have found the easiest to be the trailhead just east of the parking lot. Directly across the parking lot is Hackers Trail, which also has a trail spur that joins Cliff Park Trail.\r\n\nFor the first half mile, most of the trail is through a pine forest with a needle forest floor. This is also where the only significant elevation gain takes place as you climb to the top of the ridge. \r\n\nFrom this spot until the end of the trail, the route winds close to the cliff edge with numerous overlooks. If you are lucky and start early, summer mornings may find the valley socked in with a dense layer of fog which completely obstructs the views but is interesting in its own right.\r\n\nThis trail can easily be combined with others in the park to make a longer route.\r\n\nPlease also note that since the route takes the hiker to the cliff ledges, the GPS trackers are not sensitive enough to accurately gauge location.

You can start at any point along the loop and continue until you reach your starting point.\r\n\nI started on Northfield Ave at the corner of Sheridan Ave. There's an entrance here to the wooded part of the trail.\r\n\nOnce you enter the woods, there is a windy, steep incline. Pay close attention to the blazes, as the trail itself can sometimes be hard to see on the ground. This part can get muddy in wet conditions, so be aware. It's rather dry in the fall, and the leaves cover the ground completely.\r\n\nThe trail continues up the hill until you cross a doubletrack carriage road. There's a map on a signpost there, where you can check your position. Continue along the singletrack trail for a short while, and the trail will eventually combine with another doubletrack carriage road and open up wider.\r\n\nThere's a steep descent into a valley followed by a steep climb back out. At the top, you'll see another map on a signpost, and the trail will turn to the right to go down towards the reservoir. This part of the trail is windy and easy to lose, but you can clearly see the reservoir path at the bottom - which is where you are heading.\r\n\nOnce you reach the reservoir, the Zoo Loop joins with the Orange Reservoir Loop for about a half mile.

There are also a few brook crossings that are quite lovely.\r\n\nAnother lesser \"climb\" starts at 4.6 miles in, and traverses through several switchback sections and around huge rocks that can be climbed for those inclined to do so.\r\n\nA little less than a mile later, leave the doubletrack behind and head west back towards Saffin Pond.

The property is now preserved and public space and still a favorite for mountain bikers and hikers. \r\n\nThe eastern end of the trail starts with a private property easement, so please make sure to stay along the left edge of the property. Pass to the left of the gray barn. The trail turns to packed gravel then a more primitive trail. It is well marked with blue trail markers. Several simple plank bridges cross wet sections of trail. A short distance up the trail, you'll come across several small abandoned primitive quarries used as a source of building stone -- really just holes where rocks were removed. The trail truly lives up to its name \"Rockhopper.\"\r\n\nContinuing on, you'll descend down through more open, mature woods. An unmarked but clearly visible trail branches off to the left about 0.5 miles in. Stay to the right. Another 0.5 miles further will bring you to a small creek crossed via a stone \"bridge,\" nothing more than rocks in the stream bed. Markers for the Rockhopper \"red\" trail are visible to the right immediately after crossing the creek. Continuing on, the blue trail merges with the remnants of the Old Rock Road, which historians have identified as a road used by George Washington's army en route to the Monmouth battlefields. It is now lost in the woods.\r\n\nThe trail changes markedly after this, entering an area of dense undergrowth and becoming very narrow. In many place my trekking poles were a bit of a hindrance, repeatedly getting hung up. For awhile, the best use I could find for them was to clear the numerous spider webs spread across the trail. Around 0.4 miles past the \"bridge\" the trail splits, with the \"blue\" trail bearing left and an orange-marked cutoff trail to the right. The cutoff is slightly shorter, but significantly wetter. \r\n\nAbout 0.25 miles later, the trail breaks out onto a power line right-of-way. Follow the access road north (right) for 0.25 miles before picking up the trail heading west to the left and the intersection with the cutoff trail, marked with a white arrow. Another 0.25 miles brings you to the end of trail in what appears to be someone's front yard. There are several downed trees right at this end, making it all but invisible from the road.

There are some pretty muddy areas on this trail, and after significant rain, this trail can contain literal ponds, so make sure to wear your boots!\r\n\nThere is also a break off from this trail that takes you by an area of Ireland Brook where all of the trees and grass seem to have died. Very neat to explore, although it is technically off trail. \r\n\nAdditionally, despite being in the same Conservation area, the powerline clearing doesn't connect to the Forest Brook Trail, as the brook passes through and is deep and wide enough to prevent easy crossing.", "features": "Birding", "condition": "Unknown"}, "ratings": {"rating": 4.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 1.3, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [102, 73], "alt-change": [38, 40], "avg-grade": 1.0, "max-grade": 4.0}},
