This may be the best sky you'll ever experience for clear stargazing without light pollution.  \r\n\nFrom the cabin and nearby waterhole, the historic Ainapo Trail descends the southeastern flank of the volcano, down to Highway 11, but it has since fallen into disuse.  \r\n\nBeware of altitude sickness, bring warm clothes, sun protection, excess water and food. Expect extreme and rapidly changeable weather. To avoid getting the bends, scuba divers should not ascend Mauna Loa within 24 hours of their last dive.", "features": "Views", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7012919/snow-lava-and-rain-volcanic-crack-above-lua-poholo-crater-part-of-mauna-loa-cald", "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 2.4, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [13254, 13005], "alt-change": [286, 43], "avg-grade": 3.0, "max-grade": 10.0}},

It is not recommended to explore beyond this point. \r\n\nPu\u2019u O Hulu (hill of Hulu), aka Pink Pillbox, was originally established on April 27, 1923 as a military fortification. Several pillboxes were made here all facing the makai (ocean). All the pillboxes were connected by tunnels, and a mess hall and kitchen were built on the other side of Hulu. The pink pillbox was armed with 7-inch MK2M4-6 Naval Guns but was later outfitted with 6-inch guns.

I got the trailhead at about 7:30, right after sunrise. I had done this trail before so I know where the unmarked trailhead is. When I started out it was 56 degrees, not what most people would think Hawaiian weather would be like, but I was at an elevation of around 4,100 feet. \r\n\nThis trail starts off in a forested maze of paths. Since the trail is unmaintained and not on any current maps you have to know about it to get to it. Some trail volunteers have placed bright colored ribbons along the trail at many of the places that you could get confused. Still, it is easily possible to get off trail if not paying attention. \r\n\nThe trail itself can be narrow. There are lots of downed trees and snags requiring you to crawl under or over many of them. I banged my head a couple of times on a branch I didn't see trying to get up after crawling under a tree. The ferns are brutal, and if you aren't wearing long pants and a long sleeve shirt you'll get scratched. The trail through these ferns is barely 18 inches wide and the ferns can be 5 feet high making it feel like you are hiking in a plant canyon. In a couple of places, the ferns have grown completely over so you are hiking though a tunnel of sorts. \r\n\nEven though it hadn't been raining, the trail was very slippery. Couple that with the steepness and you could certainly slip and fall. I use trekking pokes and find they help me immensely. \r\n\nIn a couple of places, you'll look at the trail and wonder how you are going to get down it. \r\n\nAt around 2.2 miles, you come to a lookout point after passing many other places to take pictures. I could see Honopu Valley and all the way up the Na Pali. With binoculars, I could see people on the Kalalau Trail. \r\n\nTips: This trail is not family friendly. You should wear long pants and shirt, and good boots/shoes. Bring a camera and binoculars to see and record. Also bring lots of water. It's a long uphill hike back.

After a brief uphill, this trail is all downhill, so you'll be coming uphill the entire way back.  Bring plenty of water and sunscreen.  This trail connects to the Awa'awapuhi Trail via the Nualolo Cliff Trail making a nice loop trip (approx 11 mile loop).  View the Nu'alolo Cliff Trail for current conditions, it can be overgrown.\r\n\nThe first part of the trail is uphill through forest.  Once you reach the top its a steady downhill the rest of the way.  The forest gives you opportunities for birdwatching and you may catch a glimpse of some native Hawaiian birds.  More likely, you'll here them. \r\n\nOnce you break out of the forest you'll be in a open and arid area.  There are a multitude of colors.  The further you go along the trail, the more diverse the colors.  Some of the trail along the ridge is so red you might liken it to being on Mars.  There are even hints of yellow.  \r\n\nAs you make your way along the ridge towards the point, the trail becomes very narrow with steep drop-offs on either side. This is where you want to watch you step and be careful.  Along these steep cliffs you may hear and see goats.

Along the way, you'll intersect with the Silversword Loop. This worthwhile detour does not add any real mileage, so you might as well visit this concentration of rare silversword plants. After rejoining the main Halemau'u Trail, crest a ridge and traverse an impressively barren, black stretch of newer lava. The trail surface is deeper sand/dirt and slow going. Other highlights along the route include the Bottomless Pit and Pele's Paint Pot- an ashy, technicolor landscape created by the minerals found in the lava.  \r\n\nUpon reaching the crater's large inner cinder cones, the Halemau'u Trail makes multiple junctions with the (roughly north-south) Connector Trails A-F which link the Halemau'u Trail to the Sliding Sands Trail. Any number of loops can be created by using these connectors. Continue downhill eastwards along the Halemau'u Trail to where the Sliding Sands Trail ends. Stay on the Halemau'u Trail and cross patches of smooth lava making for much easier travel. Then approach the steep hillsides through scrubby, dense vegetation and grassy fields. The Halemau'u Trail ends at a 3-way intersection with the Kaupo Trail (to the south) and the Lau'ulu Trail (to the east).  \r\n\nHeed the warnings and be prepared for cold and unpredictable weather.

Alternatively, leave a car at both ends and make it into a multi-day backpacking journey by utilizing the park's fine backcountry camping/cabins with the necessary permits. Most people spend the night at the Paliku cabin and start the descent to the southern coast early in the day to avoid the worst of the heat.  \r\n\nFrom the 3-way intersection with the Halemau'u Trail and the Lau'ulu Trail, take the Kaupo Trail south across the flat crater floor before dropping off the lip and heading down the volcano's hillside through brushy, steep terrain. It was originally thought that this \"gap\" in the crater rim wall was blown out in a spectacular Mount St. Helen's-style eruption, but recent research has shown that it was formed instead by wind and rain erosion.\r\n\nYou'll almost certainly have all the solitude you seek on this remote, infrequently used trail. Enjoy watching for wildlife while crossing ancient lava flows, dry dense native vegetation and pristine forests. Be prepared for a tough, rocky path that can sometimes be hard to find. Intense switchbacks are interspersed with somewhat level sections and constant ocean/Big Island views in the distance.\r\n\nJust as you leave behind the prominent ridgeline that has been looming above, the trail crosses a fenceline from National Park land into private property. Trail users have permission to continue through, but please be respectful. The remainder of the route is on old doubletrack through ranch land. The grade steepens considerably near the Kaupo Cutoff and Kaupo Side Loop. You may inadvertently take one of these options due to the increasingly vague trail markings here. Proceed through pastures looking for the NPS markers to stay on track. The trail ends upon reaching the more established-looking dirt road and trailhead, but it is another few miles on the Kaupo Gap Road to reach the Piilmani Highway 31.\r\n\nHeed the warnings and be prepared for cold and unpredictable weather. Also, be aware that the high altitude will cause dehydration and fatigue much faster than at sea-level.

There are several designated parking spots, overflow lines the streets, but please be respectful and don't park in residents' driveways. \r\n\nAfter enjoying the enticing views of your destination from the overlook at the parking lot, head downhill on the path. If you like, pick up one of the \"loaner\" hiking sticks often left at the top, they will help with balance. The trail here is a wide trough filled with embedded rocks and roots. The going is steep and often slippery with mud, but very do-able if you take your time. The trail takes a few long switchbacks to descend the hillside, and the views through the jungle foliage at each turn are great. \r\n\nUpon reaching the valley floor, you are greeted with a surreal treed landscape and the sound of thundering waves. Keep an eye out for the fun rope swings here. Wade across the small stream.  Usually, the water depth is only up to mid-calf, but be aware that flash floods can occur here after rains. The beach is littered with rounded lava rocks and driftwood. Please heed \"Pele's Curse\" and do not remove any rock/sand/shell etc. from Hawaii to take home. \r\n\nFrom the eastern end of the beach, look for a skinny trail that switchbacks up through the improbably bright green groundcover. This increasingly eroded and muddy path winds steeply uphill often becoming a head-high gully that you hike through. This section is steamy, hot jungle travel, but be persistent! After passing through an orange metal gate, the grade eases, the breeze returns and views up and down the coastline appear. Spy pretty tropical flowers and mysterious fruits along the way. Expect lots of helicopter traffic. The trail ends at a scenic bench with delightful views deep into the Honokane Nui Valley and down into another beach. The Awini Trail used to continue into the next several valleys, but an earthquake in 2006 destroyed the trail further than this point. Retrace your steps back to the carpark.  \r\n\nNote: swimming at Polol Beach is NOT recommended. Surfing is only for the extremely experienced. The optional small stream crossing at the beach contains agricultural/bacterial runoff, so don't drink it or swim here with open cuts.

Be sure to fill out both a form with your travel plans/emergency contact info and check in with a ranger before getting on the trail. They will check in with you when you are on the road sections and keep track of you by name. \r\n\nThe elevation change on this hike is significant, non-acclimated folks will likely benefit from spending time at the start and taking regular breaks, especially to gauge any symptoms of Acute Mountain Sickness. I urge you to read the related information on the Maunakea Visitor's Center page ahead of time. \r\n\nFrom the Visitor Center, you'll go 1,000 feet or so along the road before you reach the trailhead to the left. Shortly into the hike, you'll pass a shoe cleaning station, where you can brush dirt off your boots or shoes to protect the sensitive habitats above. The first two miles of the trail are rather grueling. Be prepared to be hiking in rough sand conditions for a majority of this segment. \r\n\nYou'll cross terrain that is a variety of soils and rock sizes throughout this hike, be prepared for anything. In winter, the upper sections of the trail can have snow and mud as well. Stay on the trail, turn around if you hit mud, and walk through, not around, any tough segments. \r\n\nAt about mile 4.5, there is a short, optional out-and-back to Lake Waiau. This lake is sacred so stay out of the water, leave the rocks alone, and view from a respectful place. \r\n\nThe last four-ish miles of the hike are varied grades. The trail technicality changes regularly. It's an absolutely rewarding view throughout the climb, where you might feel like you are on Mars. At mile five-ish you'll reach the road. Follow the signs toward Summit. There are toilets at the intersection here.\r\n\nFollow the road for the final, quite challenging, mile to the \"summit.\" You'll eventually approach some telescopes on the trail, to the right will be Mauna Kea. Continue as far as you like until there is a sign educating you about the importance of the summit and asking visitors to not continue the hike further. Make your own judgement call here, and even better, do research ahead of time about the cultural significance of the peak. \r\n\nFrom there, it's a glorious descent down the road and back the way you came! Keep an eye out for ankle biter rocks, and enjoy the ride.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Commonly Backpacked \u00b7 Geological Significance \u00b7 Lake \u00b7 Views", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7081965/maunakea-summit-with-sign-it-is-not-recommended-to-go-to-the-actual-summit-for-s", "ratings": {"rating": 4.0, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 7.0, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [13728, 9153], "alt-change": [4636, 191], "avg-grade": 13.0, "max-grade": 42.0}},
