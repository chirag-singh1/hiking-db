The trail also features a branch-off known as \"The Extender\" (Extension Loop) that allows you to repeat a section of the trail for some added distance and contains the most fun and technical section of ups and downs with a well-rutted path of unsure footing. \r\n\nThere are several switchbacks, tight sections, and a higher degree of technical running that you would expect to find in the area if you're willing to push it. The trail has recently been modified slightly to accommodate a nearby construction project which has resulted in the addition of about a half mile of trail.

Cleveland donated 20 acres here to start the state's first fish hatchery (aka The Cleveland Fish Hatchery) opened here in 1931. The hatchery drew around 2000 visitors and 2 US senators for its opening festivities.

This trail was probably the most challenging of the trails I did for the day. It is rated by the Ranger Station as Very Strenuous, 4.3 miles, 4-5 hours to hike and marked with yellow blazes. The trail starts off of the Frank Coggins Trail and looks more like a game trail at first as it moves away from a railed bridge. \r\n\nAt 0.3 miles in there is a big rock face, the trail continues down toward the left a little and not straight across as I originally assumed. There were trees down at the time from Irma and the yellow blaze blended in a little with the fall leaves so at first I hugged the face, on what felt like a game trail, that ended at a waterfall with no safe crossing before backtracking a little and finding the blaze.\r\n\nOnce back on the trail, the first 2.0 miles seemed to be the most challenging part of this trail. Right off the bat, there are several water crossings (feet got a little wet). The trail continues up and down steep undulations along the edge with sections where log-like ladders are placed to assist in some climbs. There is also a squeeze between a hole in the rocks. In the first 2 or 3 miles, there will be a few less obstructed views for fall colors.\r\n\nA caution to hikers with a dog, this section is challenging unless they are good with climbing up and down ladders. There were a few sections where you could see the difficulty etched in from past dogs on the trail. \r\n\nAround 2.0 miles in is where the trail widens out more on top of the ridge and becomes easier than the start. The trail does remain rough, so watch your feet and ankles through sections of rocks, roots, and ruts.\r\n\nAt around 2.25 miles, the John Sloan Trail comes in from the right. It's a fairly short trail that connects to Pinnacle Pass Trail with a series of pink-ish blazes. Around 2.7 miles, you have another shorter connector trail with the Rim of The Gap Trail and Pinnacle Pass Trail that is about 0.1 of a mile.

The first 0.5 mile or so is pretty easy, winding down hill toward Geer Highway. The highway crossing is not directly across from where you exit the trail so it could be easy to overlook. But there is a marker and white blaze. Once out on the highway, go left maybe a 100 feet and cross right into the next section. \r\n\nThis part starts off with a single path that is lightly used before joining/using old Oil Creek Road which is rather overgrown. The trail switchbacks down to Oil Camp Creek for the next three miles. Part of road may have trees to climb over and a few wash out sections, but otherwise pretty easy, passing wildflowers growing along the road. As you descend, you'll hear Oil Camp Creek below. When you cross an old bridge over Oil Camp Creek this is might be a nice spot to rest/snack by the water. \r\n\nFrom here continue up Pinnacle Pass Trail #20 back towards Jones Gap Trail. This next half of trail will be a lot more difficult in sections, but also there are fewer sections of old road to hike along. Starting from the bridge at Old Camp Creek, within a couple hundred feet on the left, the trail will start to climb pretty steeply up the next mountain side for about 2.5 miles. This is a singletrack trail and, despite the switchbacks, at times follows an incredibly steep grade. As you climb you'll pass the top of a waterfall which spills in Oil Camp Creek. \r\n\nThe trail is not well-maintained in places and despite the white blazes, it is possible to get turned around in sections. The trail can be overgrown and narrow, so watch your footing and stay alert as you push through the brush. However, near the top there is a short side trail out to an cleared rocky slab with a great view. Head back and cross a small cascading creek which runs off the slab. Crossing the creek you'll ascend an old overgrown road which is much easier to make headway on then the earlier track.

Once there, you'll notice that the trail is much less traveled than the previous three, and you'll be rewarded with a nice hike in the woods. \r\n\nMost of the trail is a mix of large loblolly pines and hardwoods such as oak, sweetgum, ash, holly, maple, etc... you'll also pass several stretches of bald cypress and water tupelo sloughes especially at the start/end. About 1.3 miles into the trail, you can go right or left to start the 3.7-mile loop. If you start with the right side of the loop, it is a mix of hardwood forest and sloughs that run into a single lane gravel access road. You'll see lots of places where wild boars have been foraging, and you may even see one.  \r\n\nYou'll then hike about a mile along the Congaree River although there are only a few spots where you have easy access off the main trail for views. The first is marked by a sign stating \"sand bar\" and leads out onto a peaceful sandbar complete with a large fallen tree you and a partner can sit on and take a break.

At this point, keep an eye out for the blazes as there are a couple of spots that may lead you off-trail if not careful.\r\n\nEventually, the trail meets again with the inner loop and will take you back to the parking area.\r\n\nThis trail in Cheraw State Park is contributed by Brian Moore, author and creator of RidgeTrekker.com.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Lake \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7068012/a-straight-away-through-a-pine-forest-in-the-evening", "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 4.3, "dist-type": "Loop", "alt-range": [231, 108], "alt-change": [190, 190], "avg-grade": 2.0, "max-grade": 8.0}},

This trail can be looped by using the park road for 1.5 miles, or backtracked out the way you came. The trail is a wide smooth maintained path for the most part other than a few sections closer to the river maybe a little more challenging for some.\r\n\nAcross the park road from the day parking area is an open field. In the back right corner of this field is where you'll find the start or end of this trail (depend on which way you go) between two split rail fence sections, for a mile. The trail starts off following S-30 Road through a thin buffer of trees on your right which is mostly only noticeable with a passing car. The left side is more of a mixture of trees. About a half mile in, you'll come across the first of three benches with the road at your back. Just another 100 feet or so passed will be a narrow bridge that crosses a ravine that was mostly dry when there.\r\n\nThe trail switchbacks following the contour a little on the right side of the ravine as it starts to head toward the Edisto River direction. Another bench will be found right along the trail for a rest or enjoy the sounds of the birds.\r\n\nThe last quarter of the trail will be most exciting as you come out next to the last bench on your right where you can sit to over look Edisto River through the trees. There are small trails down on the right to a small stream flowing into the Edisto. To continue the trail, head left where you hike along a bluff of the river more with a view through the trees. In this area the trail is a little more slanted in parts and occasional roots to trip over if not careful. A fenced off location will sound like a waterfall inside, but that is water intake for some towns below. This area provides a few high views of Edisto below. \r\n\nBehind the fenced-in area along the continuation of the trail will be that ravine again. Climb down and back up the other side before a few more steps take you out the trail into the back area of the park. Here, you can backtrack the trail or follow the road back to day parking with spots on the left side to look out over the Edisto River through the trees.

Following the trail to the right at the \"T\" will lead you approximately 1.2 miles along the trail with views of Rocky Creek.\r\n\nIf you turn right, you'll eventually reach a portion of the trail that is gated and fenced. You are allowed to continue along the trail through this portion. However, please be respectful of the private property and do not go beyond the fence. This portion of the trail is very scenic as Rocky Creek courses through a series of rocky shoals.\r\n\nParking is available at the trailhead (1030 Chester Ave, Great Falls, SC 29055).", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Spring \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Waterfall \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7058210/waterfall-at-rocky-creek-trail", "ratings": {"rating": 4.5, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 1.7, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [309, 286], "alt-change": [31, 15], "avg-grade": 1.0, "max-grade": 2.0}},

Features a wonderful canopy of hardwoods as well as a circumnavigation of a small creek fed pond. \r\n\nThere are no extended climbs or descents making it a very friendly trail for all level of runners, but the near constant ups and downs also provide a ton of fast, quick descents and climbs just high enough to really push the pace for those craving a higher intensity run. The trail also features a branch-off known as \"The Extender\" (Extension Loop) that allows you to repeat a section of the trail for some added distance and contains the most fun and technical section of ups and downs with a well-rutted path of unsure footing. \r\n\nThere are several switchbacks, tight sections, and a higher degree of technical running that you would expect to find in the area if you're willing to push it. The trail has recently been modified slightly to accommodate a nearby construction project which has resulted in the addition of about a half mile of trail.
