Davis Arboretum is a 13.5 acre botanic garden facility located in the heart of Auburn, Alabama. Supported by the College of Sciences and Mathematics, it provides visitors with a place to enjoy a natural setting and experience the native plants and habitats of Alabama. The Arboretum, one of the oldest in the SEC, functions as a plant museum and has at its core a living collection of scientifically ordered plants with provenance documentation. It functions as an outdoor classroom for university classes, local schools and community groups. The Arboretum has three water features, miles of walking trails and places to relax in a beautiful nature setting.\r\n\nThe facility offers engaging events throughout the year including:\r\n\nAuburn's Azalea Festival\r\nRed, White and Blueberry Bash\r\nAnnual photo contest\r\nFright Night Fridays\r\nBones and Boos: An Outdoor Skeleton Exhibit\r\nPlant sales in both the spring and fall\r\n\nThe primary purposes are those of conservation, education, and research all of which support the mission of Auburn University. The Arboretum also uniquely works to protect the campus' natural resource areas, which fulfills the sustainability objectives articulated in the University Strategic Plan and Master Plan.\r\n\nThe primary mission of the Davis Arboretum is to display and preserve living plant collections and native southeastern plant communities; to inspire an understanding of the natural world and our connection to it; and to promote education, research, conservation, and outreach.\u200b", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Waterfall \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7079765/top-of-the-small-waterfall-along-the-donald-e-davis-arboretum-outer-rim-trail", "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 0.6, "dist-type": "Loop", "alt-range": [690, 659], "alt-change": [40, 39], "avg-grade": 3.0, "max-grade": 5.0}},

The trail is also very wide, think ATV trail but it is considered singletrack. You'll get in about 10 miles of fast trail before you encounter more up and down trail as you return to the parking lot.  \r\n\nThe trail is marked with yellow arrows but they can be difficult to locate at times. It is highly recommend you download the GPX file to your GPS or use the Hiking Project mobile app and just follow the track verses getting lost. The official trailhead is at Warden Station and camping is allowed there. However, I would highly recommend the camping at Coleman Lake which has power, dump station, and bath houses.  \r\n\nYou can access the trail from Coleman Lake by hiking across the dam on the loop trail around the lake then go immediately uphill to the left but the trail eventually swings to the right and into the Yellow Trail. Though this is a horse trail, you are likely to have the trail to yourself once you get away from the trailhead.

Hiking the trail from Toll Gate is the best way to attack, unfortunately there is limited parking and you willl have to walk a bit to get to the trailhead. \r\n\nFrom the start, the trail ascends and doesn't stop until just before the end, rising up almost 650 feet from start to finish.  You can break the trail up into two sections; Trailhead to parking lot and parking lot to Cold Spring Trail.\r\n\nThe Trailhead to Parking lot section meanders up the mountain and has Bankhead parkway within view the entire time.  Along the way there are many small unofficial trails that branch off toward the road.  It is a well-packed trail with plenty of rocks and is popular with mountain bikers and trail runners alike.  Around 1/2 mile, you reach the Land Trust parking lot which you cross to reach the next section of the trail.\r\n\nThe parking lot to Cold Spring Trail section of the trail starts off much rockier than the first section.  Unlike the more random rockiness of the first part, these are obviously more purposefully laid coarsely crushed rocks.  The rocks are likely remnants of an old railroad that ran to the top of the mountain.  At mile 0.6 the Bluff Line Trail branches off to your right, then at 0.7 miles the Dummy Line Trail branches off to your left and at mile 0.89 rocks start to dissipate after the intersection with the Land Trust Panther Knob Trail.  \r\n\nThe trail continues its climb where at mile 1.2 the High Trail branches off to the right and mile at mile 1.5 the Toll Gate Trail splits with the secondary branch of the trail continues straight ending at Fearn Street.  The primary trail heads off to the right and ascends up to a cool rock wall via fun switch back.  This is the most fun part of the entire trail.  After the rock wall the trail ends at Fearn Street close to the parking lot of the Cold Spring Trail.  \r\n\nIf you are attacking Toll Gate Trail from the Cold Spring Trail the trailhead is not easy to spot.  If you look for the yellow curve road sign the start is located right behind it.", "features": "Fall Colors \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Waterfall \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7006305/loose-crushed-rock-at-the-start-of-the-trail", "ratings": {"rating": 3.5, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 1.7, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [1492, 852], "alt-change": [640, 17], "avg-grade": 7.0, "max-grade": 15.0}},

It is described in the direction it is most often done: clockwise. Built and maintained by volunteers from the Cherokee Ridge Alpine Trail Association, who have created several great trail systems along Lake Martin, The Deadening Trail is a superb example of a trail made by hikers, for hikers. This is no boring walk through the woods on an old road bed, but an experience designed to maximize variety and take you along the most scenic route. \r\n\nFrom the parking lot, you'll first hike through a brief stretch of early-regeneration forest before descending to a rich, forested stream valley segment. This moist forest area is a nice bookend to a loop that brings you mostly through a forest adapted to the dry, shallow soils of a mix of steep bluffs and ridges. \r\n\nAfter a short, somewhat steep ascent, the first half of the loop is mostly level and covered with pine needles. The highlight here is a wonderful Longleaf Pine forest with a very open understory marked by plentiful mountain laurel. This section alone is worth the trip. \r\n\nThe second half of the loop is steep, rugged, rocky terrain that offers constant grade changes. None of the climbs are lengthy, but they can be very steep and frequent. Those with young children or inexperienced trail dogs should be aware that this section is quite narrow with a number of potentially dangerous falls. The challenge is worth it, though, with plenty of beautiful bluffs and other rock features as well as great views of Lake Martin and it's splendid blue-green water. You'll often be able to watch fellow visitors cliff jump off Chimney Rock, but the trail itself is far enough from popular boating areas to mostly avoid the excessive noise that plagues some lakeshore trails.

Here you have the chance to experience deep hardwood forests, rock outcrops, and waterfalls. \r\n\nStarting at Lake Chinnabee, the trail follows Cheaha Creek for 3 miles; multiple trails will split off and cross the creek. Just 0.5 miles in, a wooden walkway provides great views of Devil's Den Falls. Continue a bit further, and the trail will come down to Devil\u2019s Den Falls with a very large and deep pool to swim in at the bottom (you'll typically find people swimming during the summer months).\r\n\nTwo miles beyond the creek, the trail climbs 1,000 feet and connects with the Pinhoti Trail.
