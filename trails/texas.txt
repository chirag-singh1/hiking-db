The south trail is recommended, crossing over a series of interesting striped rock formations, but requires caution due to its more technical nature.\r\n\nThe paths soon rejoin, and after a couple more forks, Cardiac Hill passes an intersection with South Cardiac Hill and Castner Range Fence Line. South Cardiac Hill climbs to a nice viewpoint and is a more challenging and technical trail. The main path turns north and descends through an area of erosion damage to a dry creek bed. The exit for South Ridge and The Maze is here. Cardiac Hill continues on the other side of the creek bed shortly thereafter but is easy to miss; the path only coincides with the creek bed for about a hundred feet. The GPS track can help here.\r\n\nThe trail winds a little further, rejoining the southern route, and crosses another creek bed. The grassy West Cardiac Hill splits off right afterwards, and the main trail turns south. The remainder is rockier but not much more difficult.

Whether you take the route to its full extent or only travel as far as the chimney features, this is still an iconic desert route. The way out is mostly downhill, and this makes for an especially pleasant route if you have a shuttle vehicle parked at the end of the trail at Old Maverick Road.\r\n\nStarting at the Chimneys Trail Parking Area, head west along the trail, descending gently on a smooth tread for approximately 2.5 miles before reaching the trail's grandest feature: the Chimneys. \r\n\nFormed from magma injecting into cracks in overlying rock, and the erosion of said overlying rock, the Chimneys have held a special place in history since ancient times. In more recent times, this area was used as a popular place of congregation for Native Americans in the area, evidenced by the pictographs and other forms of Native American art found near the base of the monoliths.\r\n\nAfter viewing the Chimneys, the most common approach is to return the way you came, back to the parking area. For the more seasoned hikers, however, continuing west along the trail provides visitors with a longer, yet enjoyable journey through an arid desert and sandy washes to the trail's end near a junction with Old Maverick Road. Those who chose to follow the trail to this length usually do so with a shuttle car placed at the trailhead off Old Maverick Road, so take that into consideration as you plan your trip. \r\n\nWhether hiking the shorter distance to the Chimneys, or the longer one to Old Maverick Road, be sure to bring plenty of water with you, as Big Bend's arid climate coupled with improper hydration can spell trouble for even the most seasoned hiker.

This is an interesting bumpy ride for about two hours, or longer depending on your vehicle. Past the Mariscal Mine, you'll turn left on the road towards Talley. There are a few primitive drive-in campsites back in this area which would be a good choice to stay at if you want to take on this hike, so that you can get on the trail early. \r\n\nEventually, you'll come to a parking area with a trailhead sign. Make sure to lock up your vehicle and take valuables with you. MOST IMPORTANTLY be sure to bring a LOT of water! The climate is extremely arid, there is NO SHADE on this trail, and you'll get baked in the middle of the day, especially in the warmer months (April-October). At least two full liters per person is recommended. An umbrella would be helpful, as would long sleeves and sunscreen. This trail is very remote and help is far away.\r\n\nOnce you begin the trail, you'll be navigating over relatively flat, rocky and sandy terrain towards the canyon. Note that this trail is marked by stacked piles of rocks so you must be careful not to lose your way. You'll pass several interesting rock formations on your way. Eventually the trail will start climbing upwards gently. To your right, you'll get nice views of the Rio Grande which was invisible from the parking area. As you climb up you'll also get great views of the Chihuahuan Desert behind you and the Chisos Mountains in the distance. The trail will begin to get more steep as you approach the canyon. There are a few large boulders to sit and rest along the way. \r\n\nOnce you reach the top, you can continue all the way to the canyon edge for a dizzying view of the canyon cliffs down to the Rio Grande running below. From here, you realize your efforts have paid off. There are several ledges with great views of the canyon that few visitors ever see. From here you can continue the trail to Cross Canyon Trail if you are feeling extra ambitious, or you can turn around and enjoy more spectacular views on the way down. The trail is slippery and dangerous on the way back down, especially with tired legs. You'll realize then just how high you have climbed as you make your way down.

Cinnabar is a toxic ore of HgS (mercury sulfide), and mercury is also extremely toxic, so take appropriate care.  \r\n\nAs you travel towards the Rio Grande, the landscape changes from desert scrubland to grassland near the river. Once River Road East turns north (after the intersection with Solis Road), the surface becomes covered in white crystals that really reflect the sunlight.

The main trail can be accessed from either side of the range by Mundy's Gap, though the western portion is a shorter route. A lesser-used, more challenging path can be taken via the North Franklin Ridgeline, which connects near the top of the main trail.\r\n\nThe trail begins just east of the high point of Mundy's Gap at a signed intersection. The first half mile of the route is a well-defined singletrack that alternates between rocky and smooth sections. The rocky sections have a few technical portions but can still be surmounted easily, with relatively low grades. A number of the east side trails branching out from Chuch Heinrick Park and Bowen Ranch can be seen from here. About two-thirds of a mile in, the climb becomes noticeably steeper, which will continue until the summit, with a few short breaks.\r\n\nAfter a switchback, the trail turns west at a small flat portion. Indian Peak, with a small metal structure on top, is visible to the east. A narrow singletrack branches off towards the peak. However, it is on Castner Range land, which has not been formally cleared of Army munitions and is closed property.\r\n\nAs the trail proceeds west it becomes considerably rockier, demanding focus and a slower pace. Desert grass has grown high up on the mountainside here. After several switchbacks, the trail takes a final turn to the south at the intersection of North Franklin Ridgeline. The Ridgeline trail is a more direct route down to the west side, but has several loose rock sections and is a difficult descent.\r\n\nThe summit is another half mile ahead, with the trail becoming marginally smoother towards the top. Unlike most area peaks, the top has been flattened out to an area the size of a small parking lot. Years ago, a developer intended to build a restaurant on the top of the peak, with a road connecting to the east side roughly along the current trail and Mundy's Gap.

Winding and gritty, there are fewer rocks to contend with compared to other Franklin Mountain routes. The trail is flat as it passes through knee high desert grasses. To the west, an excellent view of the red canyons cutting into the mountains can be had.\r\n\nSome maps depict a trail marked as \"Bad Road\" near the half mile point. This is an old jeep road, which has long since become overgrown and is unnavigable a few hundred feet after leaving Blue Moon. Continuing on, sotols begin to grow up around the path and it reaches its smoothest section; enjoy it, as rock-free trail segments are a luxury in El Paso.\r\n\nAfter passing Mad Cow and near the mile point, the trail zig zags and drops through an arroyo. Cyclists refer to this area as Deadman's Drop. Rocks make their way back onto the trail following the crossing. The next three quarters of a mile feature several intersections with other area trails. Many are marked with signs. Blue Moon stays mostly flat here, passing between hills and on the top of ridges. Mule Shoe is a fun, short diversion to the west, and another detour to the east on Cardiac Hill leads to a view of a natural stone arch.\r\n\nSouth of Cardiac Hill's turnoff, Blue Moon is a dead end - for now, at least.

The footing is often loose and the steep incline can make climbing the trail even more difficult.\r\n\nHowever, hikers taking on the challenging climb of Directissimo are rewarded by the views. Vistas to the east reach far into the distance, and a huge portion of the El Paso - Ciudad Juarez metroplex can be seen from most parts of the trail. The close-in scenery of desert plant life is impressive as well, with huge numbers of cacti and sotols growing alongside the path. These can be a hindrance on occasion when their sharp leaves grow into the trail, but flora is cut back by rangers on a semi-regular basis. The trail is also well-marked, making it easy to follow for the most part.\r\n\nDirectissimo is a series of constant twists and turns as it climbs the mountain.

The trail splits off from Vertigo Ridge just east of two utility poles. A singletrack path makes a low grade but somewhat technical climb towards the north end of Crazy Cat Mountain. The path is rocky, even by Franklin Mountains standards, and requires hikers to keep their eyes down to keep from tripping. Several sections cross large areas of rock slab and seem to lose the trail. Keep pressing forward; it picks up shortly after. Bike tracks often help show the way.\r\n\nThe trail turns west near Palisades Connector. As the trail circles counterclockwise around the north end of the mountain, a spur to the left goes to the top.\r\n\nThe high point of Crazy Cat is on the northwest corner. From here on out, it's a steady descent. The trail stays as rocky and technical as it was on the climb, so while it is tempting to pick up momentum, the terrain keeps speed in check. However, the slower pace allows hikers to enjoy the outstanding view. Crazy Cat towers above the western suburbs and looks across the Rio Grande into the New Mexican desert. The perspective is one of the best in the area.\r\n\nCrazy Cat nears cliffside luxury homes around the mile and a quarter point. It then switches back down to two large water tanks. The \"main\" trail ends just west of the tanks.\r\n\nHere, two decisions are available if not turning back to make the challenging return trip. Some trail users will take the access road from the tanks to Piedmont Drive, going around the vehicle fence at the bottom. From there, it's a mile on the road to the main Palisades Canyon entrance on Robinson.\r\n\nThe second option is to follow the trail as marked here. Due to a bulldozed area just south of the tanks, it is necessary to keep to the west side of the clearing, descending into the dirt field. The singletrack ends at this point, but continuing forward to the far end will lead to a runoff area between houses that can be followed. This unmaintained section will require navigating some plant growth and rocks before it ends at La Cruz Drive. This can serve as an access point, or hikers can circle back to the main entrance or the Sinai Connector on the streets.", "features": "Views", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7045718/view-of-crazy-cat-mountain", "ratings": {"rating": 3.8, "num_reviewers": 4}, "stats": {"dist": 1.9, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [4601, 3988], "alt-change": [132, 630], "avg-grade": 8.0, "max-grade": 20.0}},

After passing underneath the tram platform, it makes a quick descent down the rock face. A few chain-assisted segments have been set up here to help with balance; some hikers may find the scramble challenging. Jackaloop Trail splits off to the north at the bottom of this initial descent and, due to the steep climb on Directissimo, is the recommended direction if making the full loop around Ranger Peak.\r\n\nRanger Peak Loop then begins a clockwise circle around its summit. A short diversion near a rock shelter to the utility poles provides a nice view of eastern El Paso and Ciudad Juarez. The trail then turns west for its flat portion, interrupted by another chain-assisted climb around the third-mile point.\r\n\nAt the trail's southern apex, another nice viewpoint can be found just a few feet off the path to the left. Next to it, a singletrack heads off to the south along the ridgeline. While often taken by area hikers, this is not intended as a public use trail.\r\n\nIf hiking Ranger Peak Loop in the opposite direction, note that the trail appears to split from this area until returning to the tram, so look ahead carefully before proceeding if the path appears uncertain.\r\n\nProceeding northwest, the trail remains relatively flat as it crosses the signed junction with Thousand Steps Trail.

About three quarters of a mile into Thousand Steps Trail, just before an eastern segment turns to the south, look left for a small, rocky area cleared of the usual mountainside vegetation. A very faint singletrack will be visible on the other side and is where the trail begins.\r\n\nThe Crash Site Trail is rugged, rocky, and steep. It is also unmaintained, meaning that some sections may have damage from thunderstorms or erosion, and plants may be encroaching upon the trail. Take advantage of the Hiking Project mobile app or the GPS track available here, and refer to it frequently, as it is often indistinct. Follow the trail as it weaves up the mountain face, eventually circling around an elevated section and making a mostly straight path to the east. Be careful, as there are a few false trails splitting off that may not be obvious for a hundred feet or so.\r\n\nLooking up the mountain, a ledge-like outcropping will be visible a little ways down from the top. This is the location of the site and is a useful reference point as the trail climbs. As it reaches the north side of the elevated ridge, the path enters an area thick with century plants. It's scenic, but it can also make the trail hard to follow. Not long after, the trail then proceeds along a slab rock section before picking up again on the other side.\r\n\nDebris from the crash will start to appear around a third of a mile in. Landing gear struts, tires, engines, propeller blades, and other aircraft parts are scattered around.

I was delighted to find Cleburne State Park and its trails only an hour away. \r\n\nMy favorite and the most traveled path is Fossil Ridge Trail. \"Just\" at 2.6 miles in length, it does in actuality flow seamlessly into two connecting trails  - The Camp Creek Loop on the west end and Coyote Run Nature Trail on the east end. This gives a lot of flexibility in planning a visit, either short or long.\r\n\nI like this trail both for it's beauty and it's ruggedness and challenging short climbs. You may be hiking on a relatively flat path and then find yourself climbing or descending steep limestone rock outcrops. Visitors may find themselves passing through dense woodland and then find yourself traversing rocky cedar breaks. It's like being on a typical eastern woodland trail and then stepping into the barren beauty of the western desert. \r\n\nTrue to its name, fossils abound, so keep your eyes on the rocky sections of trail, not only to keep your footing but to see what kind of interesting fossil you could discover.\r\n\nOne aspect of this trail and others in the park is that it is hard to get lost, simply because the park itself is relatively small and its boundaries are all fenced. Armed with a trail map, most hikers will be fine. The one caveat to this is that here and there along the trail you'll find unmarked trails that others have made. Some will turn out to be a shortcut, some lead nowhere. So while not absolutely necessary, a good GPS does come in handy if you are the curious explorer type. That said, if you do get lost it is not far in any direction to a boundary fence line or a park road.\r\n\nIt does tend to get a little crowded on weekends and holidays, so I would advise for the best experience go on week days. Water is never a problem either, you can find it at marked restroom areas and from spigots in the various campgrounds.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Lake \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Spring \u00b7 Swimming \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "All Clear"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7053057/beginning-of-the-spillway-trail-get-a-good-running-start", "ratings": {"rating": 4.3, "num_reviewers": 3}, "stats": {"dist": 2.6, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [875, 751], "alt-change": [214, 151], "avg-grade": 3.0, "max-grade": 13.0}},

The trail is open in most areas so wind and sun exposure can be concerns.\r\n\nWhile at Clarity Tunnel:\r\nDo not touch bats - alive or dead.\r\nDo not make loud noises.\r\nDo not shine lights or throw objects at bats.\r\nDo not linger inside tunnel.\r\nRaise as little dust as possible as you pass through the tunnel.\r\nWear long sleeved outerwear and hats while traveling through the tunnel.\r\n\nIn 1992, TPWD acquired a donation of 64.25 miles of a 1920's era railroad right-of-way stretching from the Western trailhead at South Plains atop the Caprock Escarpment to the Eastern trailhead at Estelline in the Red River Valley. The Caprock Canyons Trailway opened in 1993 as part of the national Rails-to-Trails program converting abandoned railroad right-of-way to hiking, biking, and equestrian trails. The Trailway also runs through the 742 foot long Clarity Tunnel, one of the last active railroad tunnels in Texas and home to a population of Mexican free-tailed bats.", "condition": "Unknown"}, "ratings": {"rating": 4.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 18.0, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [3219, 2584], "alt-change": [154, 785], "avg-grade": 1.0, "max-grade": 17.0}},

This rough, rock-strewn trail requires constant attention to pathfinding and can be very mentally tiring.\r\n\nThe track splits off from Recharge Trail at a signed map and a trail marker just east of Bluff Spurs. It is a rocky, moderately technical singletrack, at times widening to doubletrack. The rocks come in varying sizes. While they don't require any climbing, they often create hazardous footing throughout Sendero Balcones' four-plus miles, and therein lies most of the challenge of this route. It requires an eyes-down approach to hiking and a slower pace than other area trails. On the up side, nearly the entire trail is covered by tree canopy, providing plenty of shade from the scorching Texas sun.\r\n\nThe path makes a steady, low-grade climb up to the top of one of the Balcones' many hills over its first mile. The second entry to Bluff Spurs is found about a half mile in, at another map/marker intersection. From here, it's a remote-feeling mile and a half to the next intersection, with a few brief smooth segments breaking up the constant rock hopping and dodging. Thanks to the thick tree cover, the view doesn't change much, but the plant life makes the air fragrant and cool.\r\n\nWildcat Canyon Trail and Far Reaches Trail come together just before the two mile point. The high point of the trail is about a half mile after, and a noticeable descent follows. The signed turnoff for Twin Oaks Trail is also the edge of the Protected Habitat Area, which takes up the northeast section of the park. Open September through February to pedestrians only, these trails are similarly rocky but may provide more opportunity to view undisturbed wildlife and plants. Sendero Balcones will follow the western edge of the Habitat for its remainder.\r\n\nWatch for a flat rock creek crossing a little after the three mile point, near the first turnoff for Black Hill Loop. The last climb follows soon thereafter. A few faint false leads will split off to the left; keep an eye out for the brown trail markers to keep on track.\r\n\nThe second turnoff for Black Hill Loop is easy to miss, as the signs face away from the trail.

The northern end starts at a large gate close to where Sendero Balcones turns west.

Some grass overgrowth helps cushion the path even further, making it a welcome break from the rocky trails that connect to it.\r\n\nA greater variety of plant life is present along Black Hill Loop. Look for different types of cacti and some very large sotol plants. Black Hill is also much more open to the sky, with some nice large clearings to break up the forested sections. A few rocky sections add some changes, but they are not technical, making for an easy and fast first two miles.\r\n\nAt the mile and a half point, where the path turns back towards the trailhead, there is a huge cactus field to the left of the trail. Cave Creek Trail is at the southern end of a large clearing just after this section. There are only brown markers to show where the trail splits off, so keep an eye out for a dirt singletrack branching to the right.\r\n\nAs Black Hill nears the two-mile point, a neighborhood is visible to the left. Not long after, the trail begins a quick descent followed by a half-mile climb, twisting frequently as it goes. The route is much more challenging through these sections, requiring some careful footwork to pick a clean line through the rocks which have started to appear. The more technical character of the trail will continue until the end, also throwing in some roots growing across the path which can catch an unsuspecting hiker's foot.\r\n\nThe marker for La Subida Trail is parallel to the path and not easily seen, but there are markers for Black Hill on either side to help point it out.

A comfortably wide doubletrack, it is scattered with rocks that are large and plentiful enough to be inconvenient but rarely cause trouble for an experienced hiker.\r\n\nFor much of its length, Joe Johnston runs alongside Government Canyon Creek, which is occasionally visible through the trees to the right. Signs for the Natural Area's popular dinosaur tracks are posted every half mile, along with frequent trail markers. It's impossible to get lost here.\r\n\nOnly a few hundred feet in, the Recharge Trail breaks off to the right. Joe Johnston then begins in earnest as a low grade climb to the north. The combination of scattered rocks, easy incline, and ample tree shade make this a good trail for a beginner migrating off of gravel paths. Rocky and smooth sections alternate frequently through the first two and a half miles of the route, providing plenty of rest opportunities for hikers who aren't used to dodging trail debris.\r\n\nBenches, markers, and maps mark the turnoffs for Wildcat Canyon Trail, Twin Oaks Trail, and Caroline's Loop. Other than those, the only real change in scenery for the first half of Joe Johnston is the remains of a corral at the three-quarter mile point.\r\n\nAt two and three-quarters miles, the trail opens up into a clearing at the base of a bluff. This is the site of Government Canyon's 110 million year old dinosaur tracks, left behind when the Gulf of Mexico reached this point. An informational sign has more details. An even better view of the tracks can be had from the Overlook Trail, which can be accessed a quarter mile ahead.\r\n\nFollowing the tracks, the trail passes through a surreal, impressive canopy of Spanish moss, drooping down from the trees above. Joe Johnston then comes upon the Zizelmann House, an abandoned limestone home built by German settlers in the 1800's.\r\n\nFrom here to the finish, the trail ramps up in technical difficulty, mostly from an increase in the number of rocks in the trail. A pit bathroom is available at the turnoff to Little Windmill Trail, and one final intersection is found at Caroline's Loop near a wide dry creek crossing.

To the right is Slaughter Creek, but don't get too excited because it is usually small and not visible from the trail. Watch for the signs that tell you about the Native Americans that frequently visited this area to collect flint for making tools.\r\n\nFinish your hike back at the old ranch house that was occupied from the 1850's until the 1950's.

The trail continues to the north end of the High Berm Trail, where improvised bridging crosses the borrow ditch to the south.  Continuing east, there is improvised bridging over a low point before arriving at the junction with Noack Trail.\r\n\nMoving east from this point the trail is generally wide and well-drained, with a barbed wire fence on the south side. The Phillips Cutoff offers a high-ground route to the north end of Noack Trail and to North Eldridge Parkway that is less prone to high water than western Bauer Trail. The Hermann Hospital Trail to the south begins where the barbed wire fence ends.\r\n\nAs the trail nears Turkey Creek, it turns southeast for about 1/10 of a mile then curves southward. An improvised bridge over the north borrow ditch provides access to the Banzai Pipeline Trace.   Bauer Trail continues south, paralleling Turkey Creek, and crossing Miles Trail before becoming fainter and fainter until ending at Turkey Creek. \r\n\nAccording to US Army Corps of Engineers' records, the first mile of this road was the southern boundary of a tract of about 354 acres owned by Jerry C. Bauer and his wife. The land on the south side of the road was owned by Tim Miles et al. At the Hermann Hospital Trail intersection the trail enters land that was owned by the Herman (sic) Hospital Trust.", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7077554/bauer-trail-running-north-south-west-of-turkey-creek-between-malsbury-and-miles", "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 2.7, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [93, 85], "alt-change": [0, 8], "avg-grade": 0.0, "max-grade": 1.0}},

Regardless of starting position, it is important to note that hikers should travel in a counterclockwise direction. This park is used fairly regularly by cyclists that travel in the opposite direction for increased safety and visibility.  \r\n\nIf following the attached track, the trail will begin across from a small parking area/pavilion, and pond. There will be a monument sign at the start of the trail that sometimes has posted information, but don't count on it to contain a trail map as it isn't always up-to-date. Bring the Hiking Project mobile app to help keep yourself oriented. \r\n\nThe first third of this trail travels through heavy tree cover with many turns and twists that travels by creeks and fields.  There are several places where trail navigation can be tricky, but just stick to the posted signage and you'll likely remain on the correct path. After meandering back and forth in the forest, you begin to weave in and out of fields that are covered in wildflowers in the spring, and thick prairie grass the rest of the year.  \r\n\nWhen hiking through the fields be sure the keep an eye out for cyclists as they tend to pick up speed in the open areas of the trail.  Proper trail etiquette states they should yield to those on foot, but for safety's sake be prepared to step aside and give them the right of way.  \r\n\nAfter large stretches of the trail finish winding through some massive fields, you again reenter the forest where you'll pass by some small ponds and additional creekways. This trail has tons of tripping hazards with exposed roots so mind your step. Don't forget that you are in the forest so keep your eyes open for those that slither, as they are present as well as other wildlife.  \r\n\nOverall, this is a great trail that has you traveling up and down constantly throughout your journey. This is a wonderful respite from the hustle and bustle of city life and has tons to offer every hiker and outdoor enthusiasts.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 Lake \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7030271/the-trail-passes-through-many-large-fields-that-with-the-right-timing-offer-a-wo", "ratings": {"rating": 4.2, "num_reviewers": 9}, "stats": {"dist": 8.1, "dist-type": "Loop", "alt-range": [709, 591], "alt-change": [486, 482], "avg-grade": 2.0, "max-grade": 8.0}},

Both warn of potential encounters with local reptilian life in the form of snakes and yes, even alligators, so be prepared to mind your step as you wander along the creek banks. \r\n\nThe trail follows the creek wandering in and out of large groves of trees.

The trail ends with a hike between a wash to the east and two low-lying areas to the west, which fill with water during the wet season. During the dry season, they are covered with prairie grass and are excellent deer and nilgai habitat. \r\n\nThere is very limited shade on this trail, so bring plenty of water and avoid hiking during the hottest parts of the day in summer. Dawn and dusk are the best time to see wildlife. Keep all dogs leashed and away from water sources, as alligators are common.

This trail is probably best used to create shorter hikes/loops with the other trails it meets\u2014if you do it end to end, you'll need a shuttle or have to hike back 13.5 miles! \r\n\nFrom the Nails Creek Unit, the Trailway begins near a large parking area with restrooms and access to the equestrian campground. It then parallels Nails Creek Loop to reach a nice overlook of Lake Somerville. After the overlook it meanders west passing the Colvin Hill Bypass Trail, Channel Loop, and Nails Creek Access Road (which is one of a few ways you can access the Trailway from parking). The Trailway then passes along the western edge of Flag Pond offering nice, slightly elevated views of the water and large bird populations. \r\n\nAfter Flag Pond, the Trailway heads southwest through a forest, offering some nice shade, before entering a large meadow and heading back northeast. This meadow should have bluebells in season, and other wildflowers throughout spring time. You'll cross a tributary to Yegua Creek on a concrete bridge and then parallel the creek to an equestrian resting area at an intersection with Newman Bottom Access Road and White Bass Run.

The trail makes for a great out-and-back, and can be somewhat technical in places with rocky terrain and tree roots.\r\n\nFrom the Hausman Trail, head south on the paved section about 100 ft and look for the singletrack that cuts off to the right. There are occasional splits in the trail, but they eventually tie back together. It is difficult to get lost since this is in the middle of San Antonio.\r\n\nIf you are starting on the Leon Creek Greenway paved trail section at the Prue Rd overpass or at Rohde Park, go west over the dry creek bed and the trail runs north/south. The trail runs through the back of OP Schnabel Park and crosses over the paved path a couple of times.\r\n\nFrom the Whitby Trail, head down the steep paved path until you see the safety bollard. The trail section runs north/south. There are several sections of trails that branch off and then re-connect along the way, but it is hard to get lost. This short trail section from Whitby to Bandera is pretty awesome and makes you feel like you've left San Antonio for a bit.

Valley Ranch Parkway. Visitors are presented with the option of sticking to the main route or taking the Autre Trail for a short detour. The southern end of the park has a large parking lot and makes a good spot to start.\r\n\nRichardson Grove: \nThere is a small parking lot and several pavilions located in Richardson Grove Park.   This is a good place to start a three mile loop up to the north end of Sam Houston Trail Park.\r\n\nKeenan's Crossing Park: \nKeenan's Crossing park is the only stretch of the Campion Trail that does not have a parking lot associated with it.  You can reach it by hiking south from Richardson Grove or north from Spring Creek Trail Park.  Either way, its worth the trip as this is arguably the most scenic section of the trail.\r\n\nSpring Trail Park: \nYou can park in the south end of the Irving North Police Station and take a short access sidewalk to get to the trail in Spring Creek trail Park.\r\n\nBird's Fort Trail: \nBird's Fort Trail Park extends from the road crossing at California crossing Road and extends northward under Northwest Highway to a low water crossing.  There is a large pavilion on the trail with a parking lot, restrooms, and water.  Most of this section of trail is between the Trinity River and Riverside Drive.  \r\n\nCalifornia Crossing Park: \nThis final section of trail starts just south of the California Crossing Road and travels a short distance to reach a small parking lot on the other side of a shady grove of trees.

The trail at the campground begins just inside the gate and then follows along the road inside the fenced federal property for about 0.1 mile before coming to the day use parking area. The path follows the road for another short distance and then dives into a heavily treed forest that provides plenty of shade for hot days. The forest consists largely of hardwood trees with dense stands of pines mixed here and there. \r\n\nThe path is singletrack, with short sections that widen out, due to trail work. It is a sandy consistency which makes for easier hiking when wet, but can certainly drain you when dry and loose. As you travel in a southeastern direction you eventually come to a small gate that is typically closed and marks where the trail turns sharply back to the west. Just on the other side of the gate is another dispersed camping area with composting toilets and potable water that is great for refilling your bottles. After the sharp turn the trail becomes less straight and leisurely winds through the forest as you near the shores of Coffee Mill Lake. Pay attention to the map and trail markers in this area, as there are many unmarked paths that lead to the lake's shore that can create a bit of a maze. You continue north and eventually end back at the Bois d'Arc camping area.  \r\n\nOverall it is a great trail with lots of shade, wildlife, and solitude. I would certainly recommend any hike in the Caddo National Grasslands, if not for the solitude alone. This is a lush 17,000 acre federal green space that is largely utilized by hunters, in season, and equestrian, but provides great access to nature, outdoors and solitude.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Lake \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7050930/lilly-pads-completely-cover-this-area-of-the-lake-that-is-teeming-with-birdlife", "ratings": {"rating": 4.0, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 3.6, "dist-type": "Loop", "alt-range": [546, 507], "alt-change": [80, 84], "avg-grade": 1.0, "max-grade": 3.0}},

There are vault toilets and potable water available at the campground. There are several connector trails that allow you to shorten or lengthen your hike in this area of the National Grasslands.  \r\n\nThis trail weaves almost entirely under thick forest cover as you travel through mosty hardwood stands with the occasional dense pine thicket. The trail is a sandy consistency, and as you travel closer to the lake and the elevation drops, you'll likely encounter plenty of standing water on your route. This area is great for wildlife tracking and viewing as you'll observe first hand, either by spotting them or seeing their tracks scattered throughout the trail. As you leave the campground on the trail be sure that you pay attention to the map closely, as there are a few turn-offs that aren't marked very intuitively.  This trail does skirt the upper shores of the lake as you make your way through the wetland areas of this hike. These sections provide the best opportunity for bird viewing on this trail.  \r\n\nWhen you come to the northen section, the trail follows along a barbed wire fence that marks the edge of the  grassland property. In this section of the trail, the path widens up providing great opportunities to spot wildlife crossing back and forth. The trail then dead ends into the first section of your hike where you'll retrace your steps back to the trailhead.\r\n\nOverall, this trail provides excellent wildlife viewing opportunities as well as tons of solitude. Because the National Grasslands is far from any large communities, you'll likely not hear anything but the wind and the wild.

Going to the right, the trail climbs steeply up a series of switchbacks through volcanic rocks that make up the hill.  It gains over 230 feet in about two tenths of a mile.  The trail is narrow, and alternates between dirt, rocks, and steps.   \r\n\nAt roughly four tenths of a mile, there is a small trail out to an overlook that looks over Fort Davis National Historic Site. This is a great place to see how the fort was laid out, see the foundations of buildings that have not been restored, and see the building that have been restored.  It's a really great view of Fort Davis and the surrounding landscape.  After enjoying the view, the main reason for taking the hike, you pass the North Ridge Trail which breaks off to the left while the Tall Grass Loop Trail continues to the right.   \r\n\nAlong the trail, there are various signs that provide information about activities around the fort and information about the surrounding landscape.  At six tenths of a mile, there is a bench at another overlook.  From here, the trail begins to descend through the rocks again.  At three quarters of a mile is a final overlook where you can get a great view of the Limpia Creek area.
