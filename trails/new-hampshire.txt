Multiple small designated campsites off the trail are marked with signs, none of which can support larger groups.

The trail gets steeper right before it climbs to Pitcher Mountain. Here, you can get some decent views. Unfortunately, the fire tower is often closed. The trail passes over a blueberry-laden ridge; there are many animal trails that converge here, so watch out for bears.\r\n\nThe trail continues through the woods and comes to a small side trail to an unnamed road. The trail parallels the road (east side), crosses it, parallels it (west side), then merges with and follows it to the left.  This road takes a large turn left, and the landscape changes. The woods give way to another blueberry scrubland. This area seems to be frequented by equestrians, so watch your step. \r\n\nThere are many different paths through here; take care to follow the white blazes. Shortly before the summit of Hubbard Hill, the trail reaches the M-S G Halfway Point. The grass path climbs gradually to the summit of Hubbard Hill, 1,896 ft. From here, the trail descends to Fox Brook Campsite. I would recommend refilling water here.\r\n\nThe trail then steadily climbs to the summit of Jackson Hill (painted rock on ground) at 2,061 ft.

Maintaining the ridge line past the Carter-Gibbs Trail over Oregon Mountain with great overlooks of Alexandria and beyond to the south and east from both peaks. \r\n\nThis trail is composed of pleasantly rugged bare rock in places mixed with peaceful sections through soft and hardwood stands. After making your way down from Oregon Mountain and nearing the halfway point, you'll reach the only truly unfortunate area of the trail, The Blight. Recent logging in the area has significantly affected the trail making it difficult to follow and detracts heavily from the tranquility of the area. \r\n\nGetting through this area which includes a large power line crossing, luckily gives way to a gentle and peaceful incline to the summit and along the ridge of Bear Mountain. It is here that you'll find two potential bailout routes along Elwell Trail, one to the northeast (Bear Mountain Trail) leads to the Hobart Hill area of Hebron, and one to the southwest (Welton Falls S Trail) leads towards Welton Falls. \r\n\nComing to the end of this restful section be prepared for a steep descent off of Bear Mountain. After the descent, the trail winds through the woods\u2014across Bear Mtn/Hebron Road\u2014for a short, but steep, final ascent of Big Sugarloaf. Be sure to watch for nice views of Newfound Lake and Wellington State Park as you traverse these final peaks! Some overlooks are slightly \u201coff-trail\u201d but worth a look and even a moment of pause and enjoyment. With well under two miles to go on the trail coming down from Big Sugarloaf, enjoy the remainder of the Elwell Trail and the many neat little features of the area as you make your way over Little Sugarloaf to complete the trail. \r\n\nI always enjoy making my way from the conservation area parking lot to the Wellington State Park beach to take a refreshing swim after the trail!

Take care with footing as there are a lot of roots and rock slabs on this climb. Around the 0.5 mile mark, the trail begins to climb much more sharply, and on a wet day, may even have some small streams coursing down it. Continuing up the trail provides occasional switchbacks and will break onto granite slabs offering some great views of the New London area with Pleasant Lake front and center. A stone's throw from the summit, the Barlow Trail converges with the Winslow Trail, and together they climb to the top.\r\n\nThe summit has a fire tower that is occasionally open during the summer months and provides fantastic 360-degree views broken only by the cell tower that also occupies the summit. There is a small shelter on the summit with picnic tables in it for wind shelter should you want it during your summit lunch. Don't expect to be alone up here ever, as the climbs from the Rollins side are easy and suitable for small children as well. \r\n\nAny offseason attempts on this trail need to factor the addition of the park road in.

At the north end of Lake Solitude, the trail meets the Andrew Brook Trail (on right). In 0.1 miles from this junction, the M-S G meets some trails at Jack and June Junction. The trail takes a sharp left up to a view at White Ledges. \r\n\nThe trail continues moderately to a (gravel) road/ Stovepipe (Downhill Ski) Trail. Continue left up the Stovepipe to the crest of the ridge, just past the Sunbowl Quad. Take a left onto the Skyway Ledges Trail towards the lodge. The Monadnock - Sunapee Greenway ends at the Mount Sunapee summit (2,743 ft.) near the lodge.

There's a sign pointing to the trail across from the trailhead. Turn right out of the trailhead and continue for about 50 yards where you'll head up some granite steps to the trail.\r\n\nThe first part of the trail is forested. If you're hiking in late May or June you'll encounter the black flies in the forested areas - you may want bug spray. You'll find mostly elm trees with pockets of fir trees. Follow the yellow blazes the whole way. As you make your way through the forest, you'll soon hit a mountain stream.  You'll follow the stream for a portion of the forest area of the circle.  \r\n\nAbout 1 mile in, you'll find an area about 100 yards off the trail called \"Emerald Pool.\" I imagine you could take a dip in this nice calm section of stream mid-summer. This is also where you can choose to go up the Baldface Knob side which would lead you to South Baldface then North Baldface, or up the Baldface circle ridge. If you prefer to scramble upward, then take the left at this juncture, otherwise hang right and go up the ridge.\r\n\nI went up the ridge. I would do this again because when you circle around you get a great view over the Baldface valley as you descend South Baldface down to Baldface Knob. The trip up the ridge is steady with some areas you may need to pull yourself up. You'll find some wet spots on the trail.\r\n\nOnce you hit the alpine region, you're in for a treat. From here, you'll enjoy 360-degree views. Once you get up near North Baldface on to South Baldface, you'll be able to see a line of the Presidentials, which form the well known \"Presi Traverse\" which hits all the peaks named after US presidents in the White Mountains.  Mount Washington is very prominent and serene from the view on top of Baldface.\r\n\nDescending from South Baldface, you get a front row view of the New Hampshire-Maine countryside. You'll get 10+ miles of visibility on a clear day and a look way down into the valley area. If you're afraid of heights, then you may find the scramble down Baldface Knob a bit much. Take your time, stay close to the rock, and follow the cairns (the yellow blazes are a bit faded at this point).\r\n\nOnce you reach the Baldface shelter, you're done with the scrambling, and a short hike down will put you in the forest again. It is a calm descent back to the trailhead. Some routes in New England have drastic descents with lots of rocks and roots, but you'll find this descent to be relatively easy.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildflowers", "condition": "Unknown"}, "ratings": {"rating": 4.9, "num_reviewers": 11}, "stats": {"dist": 8.6, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [3548, 573], "alt-change": [3310, 3093], "avg-grade": 14.0, "max-grade": 54.0}},

There's a small parking lot at the trailhead and then cars typically overflow to one side of the road. Keep in mind, Mt Clinton Rd is not maintained during the winter and is therefore closed roughly November through May.  \r\n\nThe trail begins with just a slight incline for the first 3/4 mile or so.  During this time you'll pass over a handful of small streams and brooks.  Most notable is Abenaki Brook which may be challenging to cross in high water.  \r\n\nThe trail starts to get steeper at 3/4 miles or so and also begins to get more rocky and rooty as well. Although rocky, most of the rocks are well organized and not difficult to get over. This is a very well maintained trail occasionally marked by blue blazes.  \r\n\nAt mile 1.9 you'll reach an interesting blowdown section of the trail which provides partially blocked views of the area, it's a nice spot to take a break from the steep climb.  \r\n\nYou'll reach another small water crossing at 2.25 which has nice views but when icy, along with the next few hundred feet, is not fun. After this climb at about 2.35 you'll have gained most of the elevation you're going to gain along Edmands Path. At 2.35 the trail does get a bit narrower and also with this comes a denser forest which makes it difficult to pass other people with any sort of social distancing.  \r\n\nAs you continue along you'll start seeing partial views of the Presidentials to the north, these views will continue to improve until you get out of the tree line at 2.7. Be prepared, if the wind is blowing it's going to be cold. \r\n\nWrap up with trail with excellent views towards Mount Washington when you hit Crawford Path right around 2.8 miles from when you started.", "features": "Fall Colors \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Views", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7074181/looking-toward-mount-washington-from-edmands-path", "ratings": {"rating": 4.8, "num_reviewers": 6}, "stats": {"dist": 2.8, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [4433, 2091], "alt-change": [2352, 10], "avg-grade": 16.0, "max-grade": 49.0}},

After a moderately graded .7 miles, the trail crosses Spur Brook and arrives at Pentadoi, an intersection of 5 trails. The trail continues climbing before briefly descending into the bottom of King Ravine itself. \r\n\nAt 1.3 miles from Lowes Path, Short Line enters from the left and the trail begins climbing into the floor of the ravine. At the junction with the Short Line trail, there is a lovely waterfall known as Mossy Falls that is a perfect place to sit down and prepare for the challenges to come. Immediately after Mossy Falls, the trail becomes a jumble of boulders that range in size from a small car to a small house. Scrambling is constant as you go up, over, and around the boulders. Despite the technical challenges, this stretch of trail rises only gradually and views open up from time to time as you reach treeline. \r\n\nAfter .3 miles of boulder hopping, you reach the junction with the Chemin Des Dames trail which rises steeply out of the ravine to the left. To the right is a short spur known as the Subway which takes bouldering to a whole new level. Dangle from small perches, squeeze through tight tunnels, and be careful not to slip on the ice which is present all year round. If you choose not to embark on the Subway's adventures, the \"elevated\" route provides a slightly easier path up the ravine floor. \r\n\nThe trail climbs another .2 miles through more boulders before the Great Gully trail exits stage right. Another detour here will lead you through the \"Ice Caves\" which offers a similar experience to the Subway. From this point, the trail continues to rise moderately for .1 miles before the headwall climb begins. The headwall is an extremely steep boulder/small rock scramble that rises 1300 feet in a mere .4 miles. The climbing is relentless and at times very tricky as the trail passes over patches of loose rock. Use caution to prevent falling rocks from injuring hikers below. \r\n\nThe final stretch of the King Ravine trail bends slightly left and climbs steeply below a polished granite rock face that is several stories tall.

Shortly after passing the FPA sign, you'll see the Notchland trail system (on the right). The trail climbs up to an area that was lost to history. There isn't much reference for the abandoned machinery and furnace that are here.  \r\n\nA little beyond this, the trail turns right to follow a re-location. *This re-location pulls the trail away from the eroding banks of the brook up the hill; this was probably due to Hurricane Irene (2011). It descends and meets back with the original trail tread, then arrives at the falls. These falls are a great spot to take a break. The trail switchbacks along the south edge of the falls, then climbs up to Nancy Pond and Norcross Pond.  \r\n\nAfter the ponds, the trail becomes fairly standard and ends at Carrigain Notch Trail. *Most of this area owes its name to Nancy Barton, who died out here in the winter of 1788. Nancy was buried by the brook where they found her; there are those that say her cries can still be heard within the forest. Perhaps, one day, she will be re-united with the remains of Jim Swindell and finally be at peace.\r\n\nFor more information on this story, check out this link:   outdoors.org/resources/amc-\u2026", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Lake \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7080117/this-may-be-equipment-that-was-used-in-coordination-with-the-nearby-furnace", "ratings": {"rating": 4.3, "num_reviewers": 3}, "stats": {"dist": 7.2, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [3140, 1014], "alt-change": [2274, 1122], "avg-grade": 9.0, "max-grade": 52.0}},

You can park in the lot for the Visitor Center, which is run by the Appalachian Mountain Club and has a small snack bar, restrooms, and most importantly, trail information. \r\n\nFrom the driveway to the Visitor Center, cross Route 16 (carefully, there is no crosswalk and traffic is traveling at highway speed) and head to the right to find the trailhead. The trail starts with a series of bog bridges crossing a small marsh and streams, possibly created by the beaver dams you may see to your left. After the last bog bridge, the trail appears to split to the left and to the right\u2014you'll want to turn sharp right. This is the Lost Pond trail, and after just a few yards, the trail to Square Ledge splits off to the left.\r\n\nThe trail to Square Ledge climbs uphill at a fairly consistent grade. At 0.1 miles, a small spur to the left takes you to an opening called Ladies Lookout. This is a quick diversion, giving you a sample of the view you'll find at the end of the trail. Further up, you'll find a geologic formation called Hangover Rock, which makes a good frame for photos of children \"holding up the mountain\".\r\n\nThe last portion of the trail is the steepest, starting at the base of Square Ledge itself, climbing up a series of boulders along the right side of the ledge. You are very likely to find rock climbers avoiding this last bit of scrambling by roping up to climb the face of Square Ledge itself. After about 0.1 miles of scrambling up the boulders, you'll come around the back side, and a short jaunt puts you out onto Square Ledge. Mount Washington towers over Pinkham Notch with a view of Tuckerman Ravine in front of you. The Great Gulf and Northern Presidential Range extends to your right along with the summits of Mount Jefferson, Mount Adams, and Mount Madison. To your left is Boott Spur and Mount Isolation.\r\n\nAfter enjoying the views from Square Ledge, retrace your steps to descend back to the trailhead.", "features": "Fall Colors \u00b7 Views", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7036475/late-day-clouds-cover-the-summit-of-mount-washington-as-seen-from-square-ledge", "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 0.4, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [2413, 2056], "alt-change": [357, 19], "avg-grade": 17.0, "max-grade": 65.0}},

There is no official parking lot directly at the trailhead so people typically park on the side of the road. The trail begins by following Elephant Head Brook for a short distance, a quarter mile or so.  \r\n\nHowever, just about 0.1 mile up the trail, you'll reach a fork for the Elephant Head Spur Overlook.  This is about a 0.5-mile round trip trail to an overlook over Crawford Notch.   \r\n\nContinuing along the trail, it stays somewhat rocky and rooty but not difficult. The trail is generally well maintained and marked with blue blazes. You'll come across a handful of short, steeper extra rocky sections that the terrain graph on Hiking Project doesn't really capture.  \r\n\nAt about 0.6 miles, you'll come across a very short spur to Bugle Cliff Lookout Spur. Once again a great viewpoint over Crawford Notch and interesting to compare the higher elevation view to the view seen at Elephant Head.  \r\n\nThe trail continues mostly uneventfully for another three quarter miles or so. You'll cross a larger stream at about 0.85 which may be difficult to cross in high water.  \r\n\nAt roughly 1.35 miles from the trailhead, you'll reach the fork for the Webster-Jackson Trail (Webster Branch) of the Webster Jackson Trail. If you have the time, it's a steeper trail to the top of Mount Webster but can be added to make a loop of both Jackson and Webster Mountains. Mount Webster provides incredible views of Crawford Notch, Mount Willard and many of the other mountains in the area. \r\n\nIf you continue on towards the Mount Jackson summit you'll stay for a while mostly parallel to Silver Cascade. There may be a few unofficial spurs to check out the cascade if you're interested. You'll officially cross over Silver Cascade much further up the trail at about 1.7 miles. After that, you'll have a couple smaller stream crossings as well.  \r\n\nAs you get closer to the summit of Mount Jackson, the trail begins to get steeper and rockier. The final tenth of a mile or so is very steep and either climbing on rocks or over large rocks.  \r\n\nBut once you get to the summit the views are awesome. You'll have great views of Crawford Notch in both directions. Incredible views of a significant amount of the Presidential Range including Mount Washington. And great views of many other mountains in the area.  \r\n\nThe summit of Mount Jackson is a large, mostly open summit with plenty of space to spread out on a crowded day.", "features": "Fall Colors \u00b7 Spring \u00b7 Views", "condition": "All Clear"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7048676/survivors-pic-at-the-summit-mt-washington-in-the-background", "ratings": {"rating": 4.1, "num_reviewers": 10}, "stats": {"dist": 2.4, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [4027, 1921], "alt-change": [2106, 0], "avg-grade": 17.0, "max-grade": 38.0}},

Through this portion of the trail, be extremely careful (especially in the winter) as there's nothing to stop you tumbling off the cliff if you fall to your left. \r\n\nAfter successfully completing the cliffside section, the trail assumes a less dangerous character as it continues climbing through thick trees with the occasional window-frame view of Pinkham Notch through dense evergreen undergrowth.\r\n\nWhile the trail maintains this general character for the remaining duration, one obstacle in particular will give you pause. At one point in the climb, the trail leaves the woods to enter a completely exposed, bulging rock slab perched on the edge of the mountain. Hikers will need to safely climb up over this Class 4 obstacle to reach the continuation of the blazed trail at the top. While this doesn't pose as much of a problem in the summertime, a winter attempt of this trail is when this obstacle truly rears its head. In order to do it safely, be sure to employ your foot traction devices and, at the very least, the carbide tips of your trekking poles in your hands. It wouldn't be out of the question to bring a mountaineering axe just for this section. \r\n\nAfter completing this daunting section of trail, you're more or less in the clear as you continue to climb through the forest to reach the ski patrol hut atop Wildcat Mountain Resort. From here, don't be fooled by the obvious route to the right that heads southeast off the notch in the mountain\u2014this is a classic ski touring route that will send you back into town. Instead, head straight across the notch to regain the trail on the other side. \r\n\nFrom this point, the trail has completed most of its elevation gain, save for a few punchy climbs peppered across the ridgeline, so take time to really enjoy yourself as you meander through another forested notch to gain Wildcat Ridge on your way to the summit of Wildcat Mountain. \r\n\nFrom the summit, enjoy great views of the surrounding area before making your way down the short but fiercely steep descent to the junction with the Nineteen Mile Brook Trail.", "features": "Fall Colors \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Views", "condition": "Minor Issues"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7035871/view-from-the-summit-of-wildcat-mountain-a-summit", "ratings": {"rating": 3.9, "num_reviewers": 11}, "stats": {"dist": 4.3, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [4403, 1947], "alt-change": [2942, 1494], "avg-grade": 20.0, "max-grade": 70.0}},

Continue to the end of the road, where a loop provides for some parking at the trailhead. You're more likely to need to park alongside the road itself, but either way, make sure to fill out an envelope at the pay station and hang a parking tag in your car.\r\n\nThe trail begins from the end of the parking lot on a smooth dirt and gravel trail with very little incline. As you continue, you'll wind through woods and along Zealand Brook, crossing over it in various places. At about 1.8 miles, a wooden walkway carries the trail over a wetlands created by beaver activity. Shortly after, you'll come to an intersection with the A-Z trail and Zealand Pond. At 2.5 miles, you'll intersect with the Ethan Pond Trail and Twinway Trail. Turn right to continue to Zealand Falls Hut. The last 0.1 to 0.2 miles are a steep scramble up stone steps and boulders to reach the hut, but the view from the front porch of the hut is worth the climb.\r\n\nAt Zealand Falls Hut, you can use the restrooms, fill up with potable water, and purchase snacks (my wife appreciated a brownie for the journey back).

Climbing moderately from the Kancamagus Highway, you reach the small peak of Mount Wolf (3500 ft) after about 4 miles. This first part of the trail brings moderate-to-difficult grades ranging from 2-30%. From the top of Mount Wolf, prepare to descend just under 1000 feet through beautiful dense woodlands. Roughly 2.8 miles later, the trail reaches the Eliza Brook Shelter. After reaching the shelter, get ready for a shockingly steep ascent up to the South Peak of Kinsman Mountain. The South Peak is exposed and has great views of the Franconia Ridge, Moosilauke, and Vermont on clear days.\r\n\nFollowing the trail down the side of the South Peak, you enter a wooded area that winds along the side of the North Peak of Kinsman Mountain, which is roughly 65 feet smaller than its sister. The ascent up to the North Peak is moderately steep, both up and then down toward the Kinsman Pond Shelter. From the top of the North Peak, there is a pronounced rock ledge that faces Franconia Ridge, offering an excellent view of Lafayette, Lincoln, Liberty, and Flume.\r\n\nAfter descending and reaching the trail juncture, the Appalachian Trail continues along the Fishin' Jimmy Trail while the Kinsman Ridge Trail continues north toward Cannon Mountain. This section of the trail is densely wooded at times, and in the winter it's filled with snow and tough patches. The traverse begins with a steep ascent up to a 3,812 foot nameless peak, which is highly windblown and contains many downed trees. The trail then descends steady grades, dropping roughly 300 vertical feet and continues in a narrow fashion. \r\n\nThe Kinsman Ridge Trail continues through more wooded areas and traverses across the Cannon Balls toward Cannon Mountain. The trail reaches a low point at 3288 feet before continuing up a very steep grade until merging with the Lonesome Lake Trail at 3,750 feet. The trail then drops 300 vertical feet to the base of Cannon Mountain, where it climbs at extreme grades (reaching 60% at times) until hitting the juncture with the Hi-Cannon Trail.\r\n\nFrom here the summit of Cannon Mountain is just 0.4 miles, at which point you can climb a tower that offers you an amazing, 360-degree view of the surrounding area. Just below the tower is the summit lift for Cannon Mountain Ski Area and the Aerial Tramway Station.\r\n\nFrom here, the trail descends on the other side of Cannon Mountain, along the path for the Aerial Tramway, to reach the southbound side of I-93 and the trail's end.", "features": "Fall Colors \u00b7 Lake \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Views", "condition": "Minor Issues"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7022589/boots-and-views", "ratings": {"rating": 4.0, "num_reviewers": 7}, "stats": {"dist": 15.1, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [4334, 1931], "alt-change": [5853, 5800], "avg-grade": 15.0, "max-grade": 61.0}},

The trail continues to climb steadily following an old logging road. Just before the crossing over the brook, the trail enters into the Presidential Range Dry River Wilderness. \r\n\nThe trail follows the brook for a short ways, then turns away from it. The trail gets much steeper and climbs up to a wooded summit over a series of small switchbacks.

Right before reaching Parker Mountain Trail, Mount Langdon Trail exits the Presidential Range Dry River Wilderness. Mount Langdon Trail turns right; here, the trail condition worsens.

It starts from the Davis Path Trailhead and follows the Davis Path to Isolation Trail (West). Here, hikers have the option to either follow the original route of the Cohos Trail or take the High Peaks option. The High Peaks option avoids the Isolation and Mount Eisenhower Trail, which were devastated by Hurricane Irene (2011).\r\n\nTurning left onto Isolation Trail (West) will take you through a rough wilderness trail, where you'll have to rely on your navigational skills. The trail mostly follows the river, though you might have to get your feet wet (in some areas). Be mindful of areas where landslides have removed parts of the trail. Turn right when you reach Dry River Trail.\r\n\nTurn left (downhill) onto Mount Eisenhower Trail. Though it's called the Dry River, it's usually a raging torrent of white water.  \r\n\nPlease use extreme caution when crossing the river (rock-hopping isn't always the safest option).  \r\n\nContinue following Mount Eisenhower Trail until you reach Crawford Path.\r\n\nTake a left onto Crawford Path and follow it to the top of Edmands Path. Descend Edmands Path to the trailhead. From here, the trail follows Mount Clinton Road to the right. At the dogleg (in the road), turn left onto the old railroad grade. After passing Abenaki Crossing (on the left), the Cohos Trail follows the B & M Trail. At Junction 13, the trail stays right (following B & M Trail). At Junction 36, the trail turns right (off B & M Trail) towards Middle Falls. The trail follows Bridle Path to the golf course. Follow the outermost lane of the golf course around the perimeter. Cross over the bridge and follow the Mount Washington Hotel entrance road out to Route 302.\r\n\nFollow Route 302 to the right to Old Cherry Mountain Road.

On the weekends during the summer and fall this trail can be especially busy with thousands of people ascending the mountain.  \r\n\nThe trail begins from the northwest corner of the parking lot along a recently refurbished area of grave trail. Once you get past this section you continue at a moderate incline for approximately the first half mile from the trailhead.

After this area you travel along a mostly flat wide area of the trail for the next 0.2 miles or so.

Continue to the left following the blue blazes. To the right you can take the Brook Trail (yellow blazes) which is an alternative route up Mount Major.  \r\n\nYou'll continue with a moderate incline along a trail with plenty of rocks and roots to get around.  About 1.05 miles from the trailhead the trail gets steeper and then at 1.25 miles from the trailhead gets steeper yet.  You'll climb up several steep and challenging rock faces.  The final push to the summit is particularly steep.

Named after Dave Roberts who created the first comprehensive trail map of the Belknap Range this trail gives you the opportunity to conquer multiple peaks in the Belknap Range.  \r\n\nThis trail is marked by white blazes and cairns and is generally easy to follow.  It's a winding and undulating trail that moves in and out of tree cover.  Fortunately the trail surface for the majority of this trail tends to be soft and complaint made up of pine needles and the like.\r\n\nBeginning from the Belknap Range Trail a bit off the South Peak of Straightback Mountain.  This trail travels first to the North Peak of Straightback and then East and West Quarry Mountains.  During that distance you'll have a handful of viewpoints that may not necessarily be at the specific peak.  Just past West Quarry Mountain you may be able to see the old quarry site from the 1800s.\r\n\nContinuing on you'll reach Rand Mountain, there's no view from the summit here but continue onward just a bit for a a great lookout point.  It seems the most challenging part of this trail is either the trail down the western side of Rand Mountain or the trail down the western side of West Quarry. \r\n\nFinally this trail wraps up climbing up Mount Klem, you can either end at the clearly marked intersection with the Red Trail or continue on the extra 0.1 mile or so to the Mount Klem summit, which is also viewless.", "features": "Fall Colors \u00b7 Views", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7073565/a-viewpoint-just-before-descending-west-quarry-mountain", "ratings": {"rating": 4.5, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 3.1, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [2015, 1601], "alt-change": [878, 689], "avg-grade": 10.0, "max-grade": 38.0}},

You'll hike briefly along the Red Trail (may also be labeled as the Anna Goat Trail) before forking right to Precipice Path West. \r\n\nAfter a tenth of a mile or so of a decently steep climb you'll reach a fork to either continue on Precipice Path West to the left or take the Eastern side instead to the right. The western side has significantly more large rocks and climbing to start and then travels along a narrow trail at the edge of a steep drop off. \r\n\nHowever this does lead to excellent views. Meanwhile the eastern side is steep for a much longer distance, follows a small brook and does not provide the views that the western side has. \r\n\nThe eastern side of the Precipice Path is marked very frequently with purple blazes just like Precipice Path West. The eastern side begins by traveling downward a bit before it levels out for a short period and then begins to climb around 0.25 from the trailhead. The steepest climb begins after you cross over the brook that you'll follow during your ascent.  Over the next 0.3-0.4 miles you'll gain at least 500 feet of elevation climbing up a steep slope.  \r\n\nThere will be a short flatter area to catch your breath around 0.5 miles from the trailhead and then that climb continues. You'll cross over the brook at least once more as you continue to climb. This climb may have loose material on the slopes and has no man made climbing assistants, like stairs, exercise caution.  \r\n\nAfter about 0.7 miles from the trailhead you'll begin to move away from the brook and have one last short climb before the trail levels out for a while. After this leveling you'll travel through a larger area of new growth forest and some denser conifer areas.  \r\n\nYou'll begin a more moderate climb again at about 1.0 mile from the trailhead and continue this moderate climb to the end of the trail. Just towards the end of the trail you'll start to get out into some clearing areas on top of slabs of rock and have partial views.

From here, the trail follows Kilkenny Ridge Trail. The Kilkenny Ridge Trail is a rough trail to follow; it looks like it got hit by a hurricane. At the end of the ridge, the trail turns left to traverse over the 3 peaks of Weeks Mountain. There's a small seep (on the right) as you ascend the 3rd peak of Weeks Mountain. The water sources along this section are scarce, so take advantage of any opportunity to refill. \r\n\nThe trail descends to York Pond Trail, follows it to the left, then stays straight on Kilkenny Ridge Trail. There is a good water source, here; this is, basically, the only water source between here and Unknown Pond. It passes Terrace Mountain Spur and Bunnell Notch Trail, before making its way up to Mount Cabot. Though the firetower was removed, Cabot Cabin still remains. If the cabin is full, the next camping area is at Unknown Pond. It crosses over The Bulge, then past the spur to The Horn. It descends from the Horn down to Unknown Pond, where there are some areas to camp.  \r\n\nIt travels through a low swampy area, before climbing up to Mill Brook Trail and Roger's Ledge. Roger's Ledge has some fine views of the surrounding landscape. The trail travels through a brushy area as it makes its way to South Pond. As you exit the woods, the trail follows the edge of the forest to the parking area. From here, the trail follows South Pond Road until you reach South Pond Link (on the left).

It features excellent views of the surrounding area. Don't be fooled by the gradual incline though, this trail has two miles of generally rough terrain where you are climbing on and over rocks and other rough terrain. \r\n\nParking for this trail is along the side of Lake Road which is just off 101.   \r\n\nYou'll find that the first 1.75 miles of this trail are mostly flat and easy with a gradual incline.  It's a generally well maintained and easy to follow trail but note there are no trail markers.  \r\n\nJust before you reach about 1.75 miles from the trailhead you begin to ascent a set of man made stone steps.  These steps signal the start of a very steep half mile or so of trail over which you'll gain about 600ft of elevation.  During the right season this steep section may become muddy or wet.  \r\n\nAfter about 2.3 miles from the trailhead you'll start to get more and more frequent viewpoints. Most behind you but they will be in all directions and more and more expansive as you gain elevation.  You'll also start climbing on and over more rocks, this is where the trail can get somewhat rough and tiring.  \r\n\nAt 2.75 miles from the trailhead you'll reach a fork that either takes you toward the Monadnock State Park HQ or continues toward the summit.  Continue to the summit for more and more viewpoints.  A 3.4 miles you'll reach another fork for either the Spellman trail or continuing on the Pumpelly trail to the summit.\r\n\nThe last 0.75 miles or so to summit is basically all out in the open following large cairns with excellent views the entire time.  At 3.75 you'll reach a fork with the Redspot trail, continue straight to summit.  Gets a bit more steep the last quarter mile to the summit but you've already made it this far! \r\n\nThe summit of Monadnock is completely open and generally very windy and much colder relative to the trailhead.

Sugarloaf trail is well maintained and easy to follow but only occasionally marked by yellow blazes.  \r\n\nShortly after starting along the Sugarloaf trail you'll cross a snowmobile trail.  Continuing onward it'll be mostly flat for the first quarter mile or so.

Here, at Rattlesnake Cove's southern inlet, a large rock formation slopes gradually down toward the water's edge before dropping off into a beginner-friendly \"cliff jump\" only about seven feet high. The landing is wide, easy to spot, and 25-30 feet deep. Water access without a jump is found at the shallower areas to the left of the ledge. On mid-summer weekends, the spot draws crowds of swimmers and onlookers who have reached the cove by motorboat.\r\n\nContinuing clockwise around the loop, hikers pass two somewhat sandy coves opening to the south and southwest before reaching the peninsula's westernmost \"finger.\" Here, another tiny spur leads out to a remarkable vista at the water's edge, where gradually sloping rocks sprawl out into the lake, offering great swimming for younger children and anyone else who passed on the plunge at the Jumping Rock. It's also a perfect spot for lunch and afternoon sunning.

The trail travels through some cattails at the end of a field, then enters the woods.

If you're looking for a little more adventure, and are willing to hike on unmaintained singletrack, the tracks do continue all the way to Route 16 in Wakefield, NH.\r\n\nFrom Depot Street in Wolfeboro, the trail heads northeast along Back Bay to the north, and Foss Field to the east. There are benches perfect for watching the many water ski competitions that take place on this body of water.\r\n\nBeyond Back Bay, the trail crosses Route 28 (caution!) and then the Crescent Lake Causeway and worth Causeways. These are certainly two of the rail trail's highlights and provide amazing views of the lakes and beyond.\r\n\nFrom the Lake Wentworth Causeway, the trail passes Albee Beach, a local favorite, and eventually reaches Fernald Crossing. Be wary crossing the street here as this is a busy road. From Fernald Crossing the trail feels deeply set in the woods, and is nicely shaded (in Summer) throughout.\r\n\nFrom here, the trail is pretty straightforward. It passes a few nice water features, notably a pond at mile 5.85 that has some great fishing... From here it's a straight shot all the way to Cotton Valley Road.\r\n\nThis longer, contiguous trail was completed in 2014. Keep an ear to the ground with regards to future expansions.\r\n\nHistory: \nThis is one of only three trails under Dept. of Resources and Economic Development (DRED) management that have rails intact and are used recreationally by local rail car clubs, so don't be alarmed when you hear a train coming!", "features": "Fall Colors \u00b7 Lake \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Swimming \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7005934/duck-family-enters-the-water", "ratings": {"rating": 4.3, "num_reviewers": 6}, "stats": {"dist": 11.6, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [667, 509], "alt-change": [234, 143], "avg-grade": 1.0, "max-grade": 3.0}},

After passing the boulder and a boggy section with ferns, the trail becomes obvious (in summer). There are some muddy areas but no water crossings. It is mostly shaded, traveling through beautiful, quiet, wooded areas. It is an easy trail with little change in elevation, but the footing has lots of roots and small to medium rocks in places, making it a bit more difficult than it might seem. Toward the end of the trail, when you can see the pond through the trees, there is an area with lots of small boulders and the trail seems to disappear.  Look for a small orange metal trail marker on a tree straight across the boulders. Other than a few more of these markers, the trail is not officially marked, but is easy to follow (in non-snow conditions). \r\n\nOnce you reach the rocky shore, be sure to admire the views.

The gate has a sign alerting users to the closure of the Thoreau Falls Bridge, which crosses the East Branch Pemigewasset River connecting the Wilderness Trail to the Cedar Brook Trail (and essentially the East Side Trail). Behind the gate, the trail narrows and looks less used and maintained than the previous 2.5 miles of trail.

The actual Potash Mountain Trail doesn't start at the parking lot, instead, you hike approximately 150 feet up the trailhead past the UNH Trail where you swing a right. \r\n\nYou follow Downes Brook Trail 0.4 miles until you reach another right turn which is the beginning of the Potash Mountain Trail. Shortly after beginning Potash Mountain Trail it will be necessary to cross Downes Brook. This water crossing can be avoided if parking at the end of Logging Road 511 is available, however, there are only one or two parking spots. \r\n\nDoing so means substantially more incline to deal with right off the bat if this route is chosen. Downes Brook itself is not very wide, 35 feet at most, and for most of the year the brook is relatively mellow. However, if attempting this crossing during the winter be aware that this may not be possible. Due to the uneven brook bed a false ice cap forms over concealed pools, leading to unclear safe crossing routes. \r\n\nAlso, do not attempt to cross the brook if it is raining heavily or has been anytime recently, as this brook quickly will turn into a river due to flash flooding. Once across the brook, the trail begins its ascent. \r\n\nInitially, the trail is tame and continues in one direction. It then begins to steepen to and a set of switchbacks is encountered. The trail itself is rocky with many roots intersecting across the trail all the way to the top. Once out the switchbacks, a false summit is encountered at the halfway point of the trail that offers an awesome view of Passaconway and Chocorua which is off in the distance. \r\n\nFrom here the trail continues up along the side of the mountain. This section begins to steepen even more so than previously encountered. Eventually an area of granite slab will be encountered that can make for great scambling. This scramble is the last stretch of trail to the summit. \r\n\nOnce on top of Potash the views into the Sandwich wilderness are spectacular.

There is one river crossing that, depending on river height, requires some well-balanced rock hopping to stay dry. At about 1.7 miles, the trail intersects at the Carrigan Notch Trail junction which goes north (right) towards Carrigain Notch. This junction can also link you to the Nancy Pond Trail and Stillwater junction. At approximately mile 3, the majority of the elevation gain begins, and the trail goes from mostly dirt and roots to small and medium sized rocks. Be prepared for the somewhat dramatic change in trail difficulty at this point. There are multiple small trail rivers, some which can run directly down the trail making for slippery rocks. \r\n\nThe trail consists of multiple switchback sections and is mostly tree covered, but there are a few small sections that provide window views of the surrounding mountain peaks. The final ascent occurs after ~200 ft of the Signal Ridge ridge line at ~4,400 ft elevation with great views. This is the first real picture-worthy viewing area. The peak can be seen to the northwest from the ridge line marked by a man-made look-out tower, which emerges up well over the tree line for 360-degree views. \r\n\nThe remaining ascent is a final push of ~200ft in elevation and ~ 0.5 mile distance. Views are best appreciated at the top of the lookout tower. The Presidential Range is viewable to the northeast. The Pemigewasset Wilderness and other 4,000 foot peaks such as Mount Layfayette, Lincoln and the Bonds to the northwest, and the Handcocks to the southwest. \r\n\nThe trail is dog and family friendly as there are no ladders or steep ledges to be concerned with; however, the lookout tower stairs may not be safe for doggy ascent and descent. Parents, use your best judgement with your kids; the lookout tower has large gaps between the handle rungs and stairs.
