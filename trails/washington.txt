Elk often can be found here and there are good views up valley.  This is a worthwhile destination after which many people turn around.\r\n\nFor those continuing on, the trail takes on a more mystical wild feel away from other people.  Pass the Happy Four shelter, several more campsites and cross a rickety bridge.  After the Olympus summer ranger station and the intersection with Hoh Lake Trail, you start really feeling isolated.  Marvel at the blue Hoh River water as you near its source.  Wind towards the river and away from it, through meadows and dense forest.

Far from any amenities, the wilderness of the Olympics is felt with each passing step.

Mount Carrie is probably best known for getting mistakenly identified as Mount Olympus from Hurricane Ridge. While the main trail passes Mt. Carrie, those looking for insanely gorgeous views need to climb to the summit of this 6,995ft beauty. The views are downright breathtaking, with the entire Pacific Northwest expanding in every direction. \r\n\nFrom Mount Carrie, the trail continues on the side of a ridge, where it is nearly impossible to pass by without wanting to soak in the views of the Hoh River Valley below. Passing near tarns and somehow even better views of Mount Olympus, the trail continues until it reaches the spine of the Bailey Range. Here, take one last look at Olympus start your descent to the Long Ridge Trail above the Elwha River.  \r\n\nThis is seriously some of the most beautiful high-alpine terrain in the country, if not the world.

Today, both dams are gone, the Lake Mills and Lake Aldwell reservoirs have drained, and Elwha River flows freely from its headwaters in the Olympic Mountains to the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Sediment once trapped behind the dams is rebuilding critical river and nearshore habitats, vegetation is being restored in the once barren landscapes of the drained reservoirs, and anadromous salmon and trout are naturally migrating past the former dam sites for the first time in over 100 years.\r\n\nThe Elwha River Trail (ERT) spans the entire Elwha Valley, which is located in the central northern area of Olympic National Park. Today, the Elwha River is the site of one of the largest ecosystem restoration projects in National Park Service history. With its sparkling river surrounded by mountains, the Elwha Valley is a popular destination for all.\r\n\nFrom the Whiskey Bend Trailhead, the ERT extends further than a marathon, following the Elwha River the entire way. The trail begins quite moderately, contouring along the Elwha River's eastern wall as it goes.\r\n\nThe trail passes multiple feeder streams, tributaries, and intersecting trails through thick old-growth forest hosting stands of Fir, Hemlock, and Spruce. The trail's final push is a tough challenge, and will have most hikers out of breath. Additionally, the Elwha River must be forded at Chicago Camp en route to Low Divide. Always check conditions prior to your trip.

For 10 miles, the trail climbs up and up, leading to a spur in the trail where backpackers have a chance to visit Anderson Glacier. Anderson Glacier, just a short jaunt from Anderson Pass, is quickly vanishing and will be gone in a matter of decades, making this destination a priority. This is the objective for many first-time backpackers and is an amazing gateway to the wilderness of Olympic National Park. \r\n\nThis trail is a bit misleading, as the river isn't visible for much of the way. However, the sounds of the river can be heard gurgling though the trees and meadows along this path. During the late spring and early summer, the trail erupts in wildflowers, including the rhododendron, Washington State's official flower. As elk roam the forests above and below the river, the trail heading west is well-maintained and gains elevation slowly. Crossing a few stunning bridges and passing by numerous backcountry campsites, this is an amazing trail to see the remote beauty of the Dosewallips River. \r\n\nWith three backcountry camping areas resting near the river, even the most leisurely of trekkers can explore and enjoy this trail. The bridge crossing after Diamond Meadows is stunning, and will revitalize and energize you to keep climbing to reach Anderson Pass.

The trail from the Elwha River is not a journey for everyone, and should only be undertaken by those used to navigating with serious elevation gain. Starting at just over 1,000 feet above sea level, this often-strenuous trail climbs from the banks of the Elwha to the exposed summit of Hurricane Hill. This journey is steep, but not insanely so, with may locals calling it a gentle elevation gain. The main obstacle adding to the difficulty of this trail is that it is often unmaintained and can have numerous areas of downfall. \n\nWhile difficult, this outing will give views that few ever take the time to see. While you could technically take this route down from Hurricane Hill to the Elwha, climbing up the steep slopes to finally gain a view of one of the best panoramas in America make this a classic hike for those needing a slow and steady leg burning trip.\n\nStarting out in the forest and working your way up to the one of the best views in America takes work, and this trail will work your legs and your spirit, as the steady incline tires out mind, body, and soul. However, once the first glimpse of the Olympic interior expands to the horizon, your legs will feel more fresh, and most visitors find that they have a new resolve to reach the top of this trail. \n\nWith a combination of switchbacks, steep sections, areas that could leave your feet damp if you arent wearing waterproof shoes, and gorgeous meadows with deer and marmots, the hike up the backside of Hurricane Hill has a bit of everything. Snow will often linger late into the summer, giving you a place to cool down before continuing to climb in elevation. While steep, this trail does give breaks in the climb, often enough to make this a quite enjoyable, downright amazing outing. It isnt every park that gives you the chance to see a river with salmon near the trailhead and ends with views of glaciated peaks of the Olympic and Cascade mountain ranges, but this trail gives you that and more. \n\nFor those looking for a unique adventure, this is the trail that could give you the perfect wilderness experiences.", "features": "Views \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7013934/marmot", "ratings": {"rating": 3.8, "num_reviewers": 6}, "stats": {"dist": 5.4, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [5660, 463], "alt-change": [5215, 17], "avg-grade": 18.0, "max-grade": 31.0}},

All major creek crossings are bridged. It follows the cascading Fisher Creek upstream from where Fisher Creek empties into Thunder Creek, through fir forests and then wildflower-blanketed, sub-alpine meadows to alpine Easy Pass. The mountains rise steeply on both sides of the Fisher Creek Valley. To the north is a ridge that goes the length of the Fisher Creek Valley, starting with Red Mountain and then a cluster of peaks further up the valley. To the south, one first passes Mt. Logan and then Mt. Arriva.\r\n\nTrail Start to Logan Creek (~0-1.9 miles in) \nThe Fisher Creek Trail start is well marked by a sign at about the ten mile mark along Thunder Creek Trail. Fisher Creek is to the left of the trail, and close to the trail at first. The trail then begins to climb through the fir forest, veering away from the creek. After a few switchbacks, the trail returns to Fisher Creek. About 1.7 miles from the trail start, the trail emerges from the forest briefly to cross a sandy, bare, steep hillside with Fisher Creek far below \u2013 this is part of the Rock Cabin Avalanche. The trail then re-enters the forest and comes to Logan Creek after about a quarter mile. When there are breaks in the trees on this section of trail, one can see Red Mountain, with its reddish rock cap, to the left across Fisher Creek Valley.\r\n\nLogan Creek to Fisher Creek Crossing (1.9-4.6 miles in) \nA sturdy log bridge crosses Logan Creek in the fir forest. After another 1.7 miles, there is another log bridge over an unnamed creek, and then the log bridge across Fisher Creek. This trail section meanders through dense fir forest.\r\n\nFisher Creek Crossing to Subalpine Meadows (~4.6-7.9 miles in) \nThe trail continues in the fir forest along Fisher Creek, which is now to the right of the trail, sometimes close to the creek and sometimes further away from it. The trail crosses a few small streams in this section. As the trail climbs, peaks come into view above the trees.\r\n\nSub-Alpine Meadows (~7.9-8.8 miles in) \nThe trail emerges from the fir forest in subalpine meadows surrounded by ridges and peaks. The wildflowers are amazing in these meadows, especially in late July.\r\n\nSwitchbacks to Easy Pass (~8.8-10.3 miles in) \nAfter crossing the meadows, the trail climbs switchbacks to Easy Pass. The switchbacks go up a wildflower-covered hillside with views of Upper Fisher Basin ahead and Mt. Logan behind.

Take your glacier travel gear for a summit morning from the campsites at the base of Sahale Glacier.\r\n\nPlenty of people take a day to travel up to Cascade Pass each summer on the western side of North Cascades NP. The parking area beyond Marblemount Ranger Station is also a trailhead for backpacking to Steheken on Lake Chelan to the south, or Sahale Arm to the north from the Pass. If you're looking to add extra singletrack, an epic scramble, incredible views in the heart of the North Cascades, or even a remote glacier climb, head up to Sahale Arm.\r\n\nEasy to follow switchbacks all the way up to Cascade Pass. From the pass, you'll want to make a left (north) turn from the overlook to keep moving on towards Sahale Arm. There will be a well defined trail, and there are rock cairns places when the trail passes over rocky terrain. Along the way, visitors will cross a couple of snowfields, and follow some narrow trail sections with beautiful views for about 2 miles. From the base of the glacier, you'll have many options. Some turn back and head back toward the pass, though you can continue up to the glacier. Be prepared for proper glacier travel if you intend to continue! \r\n\nThe route is perfect for an overnight trip though the entire route from the trailhead would be a doable but very long day trip.", "features": "Fall Colors \u00b7 Lake \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7040545/sunrise-from-the-campsite", "ratings": {"rating": 5.0, "num_reviewers": 9}, "stats": {"dist": 2.3, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [7557, 5397], "alt-change": [2161, 0], "avg-grade": 18.0, "max-grade": 57.0}},

The trail ultimately summits Mount Mitchell to offer amazing views of Mount Saint Helens, but many will turn around at Black Hole Falls as a nice 9 mile out and back with rolling elevation gain totaling about 1,500 feet. \r\n\nThe gravel road leading to the trailhead should be passable by most cars. The trailhead has room for perhaps ten cars, but it's unlikely to ever be full - the solitude on the hike is one of its main benefits. The trail will quickly switchback down to get closer to the creek, and then cross a few tributary creeks on bridges fit for horses, and a few built from shingle-covered 2X4s set up for mountain bikes. \r\n\nHowever, don't expect the quality of bridges to continue: soon there are many more crossings on old rotten bridges, logs, or nothing at all over the creeks. It's worth noting that these can be very slippery when wet. You'll pass a small side trail that accesses the river. This is the only river access until Black Hole Falls. Further along you'll have a nice view of the creek from up on a bluff, but this is about the only river view you'll have unfortunately. Instead this trail benefits from nice forest regrown from the 1902 Yacolt burn, tons of ferns, and solitude. \r\n\nAfter about 4.5 miles you'll see a clear trail that leads down to Black Hole Falls. This waterfall plunges between amphitheater-like cliffs into a beautiful, deep emerald pool that some may enjoy swimming in. There are some wonderful spots to take a break along the river downstream from the falls too. \r\n\nThe trail continues onwards and upwards to Mount Mitchell.

The visitor center is open year round, but the hours depending on the time of year.  However, the trail appears to be open whether the visitor center is open or not.  There are several parking lots for the visitor center that you can use.\r\n\nThe trail departs from the front of the visitor center and drops into the forest.   After cutting back to the right, the trail forks and goes to the left or right.  You can go either way as it is a loop, but for the purposes of this description, the trail goes off to the left.   The trail is wide and gravel as it makes its way along the parking areas.  Moving through the woods, the trail passes by a couple of small feeder streams that lead into Silver Lake.  At roughly .3 miles, the trail emerges on a wooden boardwalk that goes out onto a part of the lake.  From here, you can begin to see Mount Saint Helens off in the distance if it is clear.   Lily pads and other water plant life are found on either side of the trail.  Ducks and other water foul can be seen in the waters of the lake.  There is a plaque commemorating the eruption and those who passed away in 1980.\r\n\nThe boardwalk ends on a jetty of land (which is an old timber railroad grade used to transport trees to the mills) that works its way back to the right and toward the visitor center. More of the lake is visible here, and lots of waterfowl can be seen here. There is a bench where you can sit and enjoy the views before making your way back to the visitor center. The trail follows the gravel path until it comes to another boardwalk that curves back to the right. After crossing the boardwalk, the trail forks again. \r\n\nYou can get to the back side of the visitor center if you take it to the left or if you go to the right, the trail will lead up to a circular viewpoint where you can overlook the lake and marshes. Continue straight until you get back to the fork and go to the left in order to get back to the trailhead where you started.

This broad clearing provides the first views into the Columbia River Gorge and the nearby Bonneville Dam before the trail dives back into the trees.\r\n\nAt roughly a mile from the trailhead, Hardy Creek feeds a trio of closely spaced waterfalls. Up first, a brief connector trail brings hikers to a somewhat-limited view of Hardy Falls. Ahead, another connector climbs to a guard-railed viewpoint overlooking Pool of the Winds and Rodney Falls. Back on the main trail, the Hardy Creek Bridge curves near the base of Rodney Falls for a close view that's complete with cooling spray.\r\n\nAfter the bridge, a series of switchbacks brings the trail to an intersection with the Hardy Creek Trail. In the warmer months, this section fills with ferns, Oregon grape, and thimbleberries. And in the fall, the yellow leaves of maple trees contrast nicely with the bold green of fir. Keep right at the junction to remain on the \"more difficult\" Hamilton Mountain Trail.\r\n\nSoon, the trail passes beneath towering columns of basalt as it climbs to the top along tightly packed switchbacks. The steep climb is rewarded by sweeping views from the edge of a cliff face. This area is referred to as \"Little Hamilton Mountain\" by locals. \r\n\nFrom here, the trail heads to the left before returning to the crest of the ridge, where it alternates between narrow ridgelines and tight switchbacks as it climbs to the summit of Hamilton Mountain. At the top, a short spur trail veers right to the actual summit. \r\n\nTo the left, the trail descends the ridgeline on its way to \"The Saddle.\" This viewpoint provides even better views of Mount Hood, Mount Adams, Mount St. Helens, Table Mountain, Bonneville Dam, and the Columbia River.

It travels in and out of forests and meadows, along hills and down bluffs, across riverbeds and through tracts of sand. Fortunately, there are many access points  each segment was created with entrance and exit points in mind.\n\nEasily the most interesting segment, Trail 25 (North) starts out mellow and works itself up to more rock terrain.\n\nStarting at the Wilber trailhead, the first three miles are a relatively moderate climb. Many intersections along the route aren't marked  including a street crossing over W. 7 Mile Rd. As a general rule of thumb, head left and uphill when presented with the option.\n\nThe trail takes an unusual plunge immediately after the intersection of N. State Park Dr. Follow the trail down a steep descent into the gorge. Roughly 2/3s of the way down, a signpost directs you to the left along a sharp switchback path into the riverbed below. Don't continue straight as the trail ends abruptly on a drop.\n\nIf conditions are favorable, head right for roughly 40 yards through the riverbed until you reach the trail on the other side. The steady quarter mile climb out of the gorge presents some challenging sections but offers excellent views of the surrounding basalt formations. The trail intersects with Trail 411 & Trail 410 Segment during this portion.\n\nThe next two miles wander up and down (intersections with Trail 401 & Trail 402), with a mile long steady climb to the plateaued summit. Shortly after crossing under power lines, the trail makes an indistinct turn to the left while a connector trail exits to the road.\n\nThe doubletrack continues, taking a right onto Trail 410, where it follows along the edge of the bluff before making a tight and narrow switchback descent onto the step below.\n\nA pleasantly undulating tail route continues along the current bluff. This section runs out onto W. Pines Bluff Rd. A poorly marked trail begins 30 yards to the left and across the road. Follow along to the end of the trail at W. 7 Mile Rd.\n\nFrom here, continue onto Trail 25 (West) or exit North West via W. 7 Mile Rd. back to the initial trailhead.", "features": "River/Creek", "condition": "Minor Issues"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7008442/hikers-enjoying-the-bench-with-the-view-at-the-top-of-pine-bluff-spokane-river-i", "ratings": {"rating": 4.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 7.8, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [2198, 1634], "alt-change": [1126, 936], "avg-grade": 5.0, "max-grade": 34.0}},

It is a key element of Sid Knutson's original vision for the Greenway.

Portions are on old logging roads and logging railroad grades.  Tree roots and rocks protrude above the surface in places. Most trails are open to pedestrian, mountain bike, and horses. However, horses are prohibited in some areas where the trail approaches ponds, lakes, or streams, or where the ground is too soft.  The section of trail from Twin Spits Road, through the Alder Wetland is built to be wheel chair accessible, so is surfaced appropriately and has a section of boardwalk.\r\n\nTrails within the Hansville Greenway are intended for passive recreation, including wildlife observation and walking, or riding.  The Greenway is first, and foremost, a nature preserve and wildlife sanctuary.

This will lead up to a ridge above Red Pond called Red Pass.\r\n\nOverall, I'd recommend using a solid GPS or the Hiking Project mobile app, in addition to routefinding skills if you attempt this hike.

From here it's all downhill through narrow trail and river crossings as you approach the intersection of the Lower Big Quilcene Trail.  The trail has many rocks and roots in this section so be sure to watch your footing and take your time. \r\n\nThe trail is best done as an out and back.

The trail starts out with a steady and easy climb to Little Hump on an old road. This is the boundary of The Brothers Wilderness.\r\n\nIt then drops about 200 ft. before leveling off in the first very peaceful section along the river. Just before the climb to Big Hump begins, there is a nice campsite along the river at N 47\u00b0 41.057' W 123\u00b0 05.029. This is a good place to rest before the 1000 ft. climb up Big Hump. There are a couple of nice viewpoints down the valley on the way up, but no views from the top.  \r\n\nDropping down about 700 ft., you arrive at Five Mile Camp (N 47\u00b0 41.564' W 123\u00b0 06.525). There are a few more nice campsites in the next half mile as well, culminating with a spectacular little overlook of a serene pool in the river. \r\n\nThe trail soon enters Olympic National Park, where you must turn back with your dog. In this area, it is pretty brushy, and the segment from the park boundary to Ten Mile Camp has quite a few downed trees, but nothing particularly difficult until you arrive at a washout of the trail at N 47\u00b0 40.828' W 123\u00b0 11.671'. This washout requires a scramble up and over, through many broken trees and loose soil. Do not attempt to cross the washout directly. It is a long way to the river. \r\n\nOne half mile later is Ten Mile Camp (1400', N 47\u00b0 40.579' W 123\u00b0 12.088'). There is a privy here, and lots of campsites. The brushy part of the trail ends about 0.5 miles later.\r\n\nAt N 47\u00b0 39.996' W 123\u00b0 14.775', Crazy Creek dumps into the Duckabush with a splash. There are nice campsites here, and the rock formations sculpted by the river are amazing. Definitely worth the side trip just to see the rocks.\r\n\nContinuing on, the trail climbs a little hump that gives a false sense of security that you are done climbing. It looks like the pass opening up not too much higher. At this point, N 47\u00b0 40.207' W 123\u00b0 15.574', there is a clear trail switchbacking down toward the river. No idea where it goes. From here, the trail remains quiet and gentle, and at times totally silent, until arriving at the intersection with the LaCrosse Pass, N 47\u00b0 37.997' W 123\u00b0 17.844'. Slightly beyond here is a stream crossing with a usable campsite.\r\n\nThe end of this section of trail is at Duckabush Camp, N 47\u00b0 39.281' W 123\u00b0 19.183'. Just before this is the ford of the Duckabush. When we crossed in mid-September, we kept our feet dry. Earlier in the season, this could be a more challenging ford.

The trail then crosses Lightning Creek twice, and at 2.7 miles goes into open timber and joins closed Forest Service Road 4320-050 for about 0.5 mile and then FS Road 4230. Go 0.1 mile on this road and turn left onto another closed road (both have trail signs) for 0.25 mile to a clearing, then follow the trail tread to FS Road 4235.\r\n\nThe trail ends at Beaver Creek Campground.", "condition": "Unknown"}, "ratings": {"rating": 4.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 5.7, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [5235, 2917], "alt-change": [13, 2332], "avg-grade": 8.0, "max-grade": 28.0}},

Fir Hill Trail is that route, tossing a few curveballs to keep hikers interested. Experienced hikers won't find any trouble here, but this is a good spot for beginning trail users to test out their skills.\r\n\nThe beginning of Fir Hill is easy to miss if coming from the 188th Trailhead, as it requires backtracking on the main route after bypassing the marsh crossing. No sign marks the intersection, but the wide singletrack is easy to spot heading off into the trees to the south, splitting around a large tree in the middle of the path. Similar to 188th in composition, Fir Hill adds more roots to the mix, so step carefully.\r\n\nMixing old and new growth, Fir Hill wanders between towering firs and short saplings. A few fallen trees have been cut or pushed back from the trail. Not long after the start, it begins a series of moderately-graded ups and downs. All are fairly short, so they're not particularly difficult, but it's a welcome change from the flat nature of most of Vashon's byways. As it goes, Fir Hill winds back and forth a great deal.\r\n\nA turnoff for the Valley of the Firs shortcut is about a quarter mile in. After this point, two or three singletracks branch off from Fir Hill. All lead back into the main route, so take any path. The sun spills through the trees as the trail makes one more climb and turns west.\r\n\nFrom here on out, it's a flat and mostly straight trip. Fir Hill ends at the Cemetery Trailhead. Cemetery Run, directly across the parking area, is an easy dirt singletrack connecting to a few diversionary loops.

Look for a blue King County sign marking the singletrack entering the woods.\r\n\nGateway's dirt path is typical of others found around Island Center: well-maintained and generally free of obstacles. A few portions can get muddy in rainy weather, but the trail was built with the intent of bypassing boggy segments along 103rd, so Gateway was made to shed water quickly. The winding route is also one of the flattest in the area, making for an easy, fast hike.\r\n\nAbout a quarter of a mile in, Gateway crosses a dirt road. On the other side, parts of the Meadlowlake Pond wetland area will be visible through the thick tree cover to the right.\r\n\nGateway Trail ends about a third of a mile ahead at the 188th Trailhead parking lot. For hikers beginning the trail on this side, look for a break in the wood rail fence on the north side of the lot.

Head north from the parking lot and look for a break in the vegetation to the right. With no signs or markers, both can be easy to miss. The route as described here begins at the southern point, where it makes a quick, winding climb above the shoreline. The path is mostly smooth, soft dirt. Expect occasional encounters with mud, roots, rocks, and other debris. Most are spread out far enough to not cause any trouble, but a few segments - generally where the plantlife reaches in closer to the trail - can be mildly technical. Use caution in any parts where the trail isn't easily visible.\r\n\nAfter the initial climb, Seahurst flattens out until reaching the first of many intersections at the quarter mile point. The entire area is a spaghetti bowl of disused paved road and dirt singletrack, and while the major routes are covered here, there are a few that break off for a few hundred feet before finding their way back. This is a good place to get intentionally lost, as even the furthest detour is no more than a mile from the shoreline. Feel free to explore.\r\n\nContinuing on, Seahurst resumes climbing for another quarter mile, sometimes at a fairly steep grade. After two crossings of the Seahurst Park Service Road, the main trail reaches its high point about three hundred feet up and stays there, with easy dips and rises becoming the norm. The frequent twists continue, making for an interesting hike.\r\n\nAfter the second road crossing, the route curves around to the north and comes to a visible split. Left leads to a short connector to the Salmon Creek Ravine trail. Going right heads to a large, lazy circle around the eastern end of the park. The next half mile is a fast series of ups and downs through the mossy surroundings, broken by the occasional mud patch in wet weather. A few diversions split off to other areas and neighborhood trailheads; the main route is generally the most defined one.\r\n\nFollowing the South Seahurst Connector, the main trail begins a somewhat steep descent to finish out its last mile. Unlike the first climb, which is interrupted by a flat section, this stays at a consistent grade until reaching the end, making for a strenuous ascent.\r\n\nSeahurst ends back at the Shoreline Trail, near the Science Center.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Lake \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Swimming \u00b7 Views", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7030625/the-trails-in-seahurst-park-are-lush-and-fun-for-the-whole-family", "ratings": {"rating": 4.3, "num_reviewers": 3}, "stats": {"dist": 1.5, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [301, 24], "alt-change": [319, 311], "avg-grade": 8.0, "max-grade": 32.0}},

The creek will continue to be visible at times to the north, and small runoff sections will join it as the road continues to the northeast.\r\n\nJust before the one third mile point, the service road comes to an intersection with Salmon Creek Ravine, which climbs to the south. Generally, hikers should turn here. The creek follows the trail south as well. From here on out, it's just trees and occasional garbage.\r\n\nThe road continues another one third of a mile and then splits. Either direction ends up in the Mount View neighborhood at the southern end of White Center, an area mostly known for its problems with crime. This can be an unpleasant place to run even during daylight hours, but for hikers who want to pass through anyway, take the left path, dodging both natural and manmade debris along the way. The right path appears to pass through private property.\r\n\nThe trail ends abruptly at a sidewalk along Ambaum Boulevard.

The entirety of the trail is a wide gravel path, interrupted only by a footbridge and paved segment near the lower parking area, which is also the primary access point. Note that the trail extends both north and south from the parking area, and its recommended that visitors explore both trail segments. While the path itself is uninspired by ordinary trail standards, the stellar views of the Puget Sound, free from residential or commercial development, elevate this to a true gem within the dense suburban landscape between Seattle and Tacoma. Ferries shuttling between Fauntleroy, Vashon, and Southworth can be seen throughout the day to the northwest.\r\n\nThe northern portion of the trail follows the shoreline, about thirty feet from the waters edge. Driftwood and grassy areas separate the trail from the actual shore, and short staircases are placed strategically along the trail to provide access to the beach. Benches and picnic areas are found along the way. Two access points to the Seahurst Park unpaved trail system disappear into the woods to the east; the dirt singletrack is easy to miss, so use the Hiking Project mobile app or GPS track here for help. Near the end, Shoreline passes the Environmental Science Center, which offers free courses on area ecology and history. The northern terminus coincides with the beginning of Seahurst Park Service Road.\r\n\nThe southern portion crosses a small creek and, after passing a covered picnic area, enters a more wooded area. While still near the shoreline, it feels much more secluded along this segment. A few connectors to South Seahurst Park head up into the trees to the east.

There is a wilderness registry at the TH and basic trail information. The trail begins heading south through old forest and enters the wilderness after only 0.2 miles. At about 0.8 miles the trail will get close to Adams Creek and you'll find an informal trail leading down to the water. Note: the creek is very silty and not well suited for filtering/drinking. You'll be in the forest for another mile or so when the trail again approaches Adams Creek with another path down to it. At about 2 miles total the trail bursts out into a large meadow that will be blanketed in lupines in mid-late summer. Mt Adams looms over the meadow to the south resulting in a beautiful picturesque landscape. A small clump of trees in this meadow marks the signed intersection to Divide Camp Spur.

Starting from back of Big Creek Campground follow the signs for trail number #250.  \r\n\nThe trail starts out flat and muddy as you travel about a quarter of a mile through some swampy wetlands between the campground and the base of Osborne Mountain.  From that point on it's almost two miles of switchbacks and quiet forest as you climb 2000 feet to the ridge line. From that point you can venture down the other side of the mountain along the Cave Creek trail or continue on along the narrow but very hike-able ridge towards the summit of the mountain.  \r\n\nAfter about a mile of ridge line you'll reach National Forest Road 8410.  The trail itself does not summit the mountain so if you wish to do so you'll need to take a left on the forest road hike about a half mile.  From there you can bushwhack your way to the top for some sweeping views of Rainier and the surrounding mountains.  \r\n\nTo reach the end of the trail continuing from the intersection of FR 8410 hike down the road for about .17 miles and look for the continuation of the trail on your right.  Follow the trail downhill for another mile until you reach the end at the intersection of the Teeley Creek Trail (#251). Down that trail for another mile you'll be able to stop at both Bertha May and Granite lakes, which is well worth the extra effort.\r\n\nThis trail is best hike as an out and back. The trail is narrow but very hike-able down the ridge line.  Back at the steep switchbacks you can really gain some speed as the trail is mostly free of roots and rocks.  There is a small parking lot at the beginning of Teeley Creek Trail so if you really can't hike back arrange to have a car meet you there.", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7078984/switchback-forest-section-of-osborne-mountain-trail", "ratings": {"rating": 4.0, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 5.2, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [4623, 1819], "alt-change": [3062, 859], "avg-grade": 14.0, "max-grade": 44.0}},

Rainier is slightly obstructed and Jefferson will only be visible on a clear day. The trail is very well built but steep - you'll be gaining about 1,400 feet in just over a mile! \r\n\nThe trail starts gaining a lot of elevation right away along dusty singletrack that winds through old growth (at least it is shaded). Although the surface is loose and dusty in the summer, it offers good traction going up and coming down. There are also few rocks or roots until near the top. You'll come a across a few quasi-switchbacks but overall the trail doesn't let up aside from a very short, almost flat section when you mount the ridge. \r\n\nYou should catch a glimpse of the imposing rock spire you're about to summit from here. The trail curves around to the north side of Sleeping Beauty and begins a sequence of switchbacks that rapidly takes you out of the forest and up against the rock face. You'll get the first of many awesome views from here. Take a moment to admire the construction of the remaining set of steep switchbacks made from stacked rocks. The footing on these last switchbacks can be a little loose. \r\n\nThe summit is long and narrow with lots of spots to hang out. The old fire tower was on the westernmost point (to the right as you summit), but will require an easy scramble to get to. Some eyehooks and the grounding cable are all that remain.", "features": "Views \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7084141/mt-hood-looking-southbound", "ratings": {"rating": 4.6, "num_reviewers": 5}, "stats": {"dist": 1.3, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [4642, 3554], "alt-change": [1088, 56], "avg-grade": 17.0, "max-grade": 36.0}},

The very best views of Adams are from this corner of the lake too. Much of the west side of the lake and part of the north edge are along the campground so there are more lake access points here and trails that lead to some of the sites. \r\n\nThere are multiple outhouses you can use in the campground too. The southern edge of the lake is bit marshy but still has some spurs to good fishing spots and access to Tak Tak Meadow Trail #136. The eastern edge offers a few lake access points with good afternoon sunshine. The trail is wide, in good condition with few obstacles, and easy the whole way around. \r\n\nConsider also hiking Tak Tak Meadow Trail #136 for a family-friendly extension of the loop that adds meadows and flowers. In theory you could take Tak Tak Meadow Trail #136, and then hike forest road 2329 for a bit to access Divide Camp Trail #112 for a very long hike right from your tent but note the road is narrow and dusty.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Fishing \u00b7 Lake \u00b7 Swimming \u00b7 Views", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7061068/a-view-of-mount-adams-from-the-shore-of-lake-takhlakh", "ratings": {"rating": 3.5, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 1.1, "dist-type": "Loop", "alt-range": [4469, 4406], "alt-change": [77, 74], "avg-grade": 3.0, "max-grade": 5.0}},

Smaller trails crisscross the park, making it easy to add variety for regular hikers and trail runners.\r\n\nTraveling clockwise around the park, you'll begin with a short incline to the east ridge. Looking right you'll catch glimpses of the lower park through the trees. Halfway to the southern end, you'll pass W.W. Seymour Botanical Conservatory, which houses an assortment of exotic plants, as well as community events.\r\n\nAt the southern end of the loop, you'll pass a Bowling Green. Turning north, the spray park and restrooms will be easily visible to the east. The playground is a great place to get an extra workout in the morning using the monkey bars, or to stop and use the drinking fountain.  Continuing north, users will pass a pond, where ducklings can be seen in the late spring.

Dense trees open up to grassy fields as the Loop enters the swamp. The  Slough Connector branches off to the left as the loop turns north; taking this path will lead to a boardwalk and Heritage Loop.\r\n\nBellefields Loop follows the creek, often visible to the left, on its western stretch.

This route begins at the Winter House, a small historic home, on the northwest side. The trail runs along the parking lot before heading into the trees and turning east. Like Bellefields Loop, it begins as a soft dirt doubletrack, though it won't last long, as Heritage Loop quickly turns into a well-kept wooden boardwalk.\r\n\nThe very short Ostbo Loop breaks off to the right for a closer look at the wetlands, while the main trail turns left then right as it proceeds through the marsh. The boardwalk ends and the path returns upon reaching the creek. For the next quarter mile, rows of blueberry bushes stretch out to the right. In the summer months, hundreds of people converge here, a dramatic change from the usually quiet park.\r\n\nAs the loop nears Slough Connector, the boardwalk returns. The previously mentioned boat dock is just after the bridge, and the Park and Ride Connector follows soon thereafter.

The first third of a mile is very windy with some banked turns for mountain bikers (who typically use this trail for descents). After this it joins the doubletrack for a bit as it crosses under some power lines. It'll engage in some more switchbacks before rejoining the doubletrack. At about 3/4 a mile it will leave the doubletrack and hang very close to the edge of the cliff. Keep an eye out for the plaque celebrating the life of a mountain biker. Eventually it rejoins the doubletrack near the forest line. Finally the trail ends at Atwood Road.

There are many well-established campsites on the east shore of Nada Lake, and the trail continues to the southeast end of the lake. \r\n\nIt then switchbacks up over a large talus and scree slope, climbing 1.7 miles until it reaches Lower Snow Lake, where there are several well-marked campsites. The trail goes over the old dam between Upper and Lower Snow Lakes. Your feet will get wet when crossing over this dam. \r\n\nThe trail continues for 1.5 miles along the south shore of Upper Snow Lake where there are dozens of clear campsites. After the head of Upper Snow Lake, the trail is very rugged. The path switchbacks up steeply: parts of it cut through dense forest, where gnarled roots grow in the middle of the trail, and sections of it cross precipitous granite outcroppings that can be very slick if it is raining. The trail reaches Lake Viviane after about 1 mile of steep uphill scrambling, and there are several lovely campsites here with breathtaking views of the valley below and the surrounding peaks, including the impressive Prusik Peak.\r\n\nA short, steep climb along the north-facing granite cliff, and the trail passes Leprechaun Lake, then continues less steeplythough no less ruggedlypast Sprite Pond and around the east side of Perfection Lake. \r\n\nAt the head of Perfection Lake, the Snow Lake Trail ends and becomes Colchuck Lake Trail #1599A, which continues through the Upper Enchantments. Please be advised: while heavily-trafficked, the trail beyond Upper Snow Lake to the Core Enchantments is a primitive route marked with rock cairns, and is recommended only for experienced users. You can also head north here and head up the .7 miles to Prusik Pass.", "features": "Lake \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Swimming \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7009303/gnome-tarn-looking-toward-mount-prusik", "ratings": {"rating": 4.4, "num_reviewers": 10}, "stats": {"dist": 11.4, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [7081, 1317], "alt-change": [5957, 196], "avg-grade": 10.0, "max-grade": 48.0}},

Climbing gradually, the trail starts as an old road in the fir forested creek valleys near where Cadet Creek empties into Sloan Creek. Heading south in the forest, the trail follows Cadet Creek, to the right/west, upstream, but not close enough to the creek to see it through the forest. The forested ridge separating Cadet Creek from Sloan Creek rises to the left/east. After a little over two miles the old road ends and the trail narrows, as it veers to the east and climbs up the ridge on a few switchbacks.\r\n\nContinuing to follow a creek upstream on the forested ridge, the trail levels off as it goes through the forest with views of nearby peaks through the trees and in a few open areas.  At the 3.9 mile mark Curry Gap, a good place to camp, and a trail junction with Quartz Creek Trail is reached. Veer left/east here to continue on Bald Eagle Trail.\r\n\nLeaving Curry Gap behind, Bald Eagle Trail swichbacks up the ridge to the left/northeast and then finishes the climb to the ridge top at about the 5.2 mile mark.  Now in grassy, high meadows with patches of fir forest, spectacular views open up in all directions as the trail continues. Traveling along or near the ridge line now until the trail ends, the trail turns east-northeast as it passes Bald Eagle Mountain, 5,700 ft., on it steep north slopes at the 6.5 mile mark.\r\n\nWith awesome views everywhere, the North Fork Skykomish River valley is now to the right/south of the trail with ridges and mountains into the distance beyond it.  Long John Mountain, 5,697 ft., is passed at the 8.3 mile mark on its southern slopes.  At the 10.5 mile mark the junction with Pilot Ridge Trail #652 to the left/north, is reached. Stay to the right/straight here to continue on Bald Eagle Trail.\r\n\nAfter passing Pilot Ridge Trail #652, Bald Eagle Trail continues on the upper slopes of the grassy ridge with the North Fork Skykomish River valley below to the right/south. At the 12.5 mile mark an unsigned trail junction with Blue Lake High Trail #652.1 to the left, is passed. Continue straight here to stay on Bald Eagle Trail. The trail then bends to the right/southeast, providing great views down the North Fork Skykomish River drainage from its headwaters and sources here on this ridge. A mile after the Blue Lake High Trail #652.1 junction the PCT is reached at Dishpan Gap where Bald Eagle Trail ends.", "features": "Commonly Backpacked \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7079554/snowy-glacier-peak-is-in-the-distance-to-the-north-seen-from-a-lookout-at-the-ba", "ratings": {"rating": 5.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 13.4, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [5812, 2419], "alt-change": [4921, 1800], "avg-grade": 10.0, "max-grade": 67.0}},

Right after the crossing, there is a fork and a sign for Bean Creek Trail #1391.1 with one arrow pointing seemingly between the two trails. Go left to continue up Bean Creek into a meadow and then up to Bean Peak. The right fork climbs to a saddle on Earl Peak's south ridge. As the trail climbs, the tops of Stuart and Ingalls start to rise behind Bean Peak to the northwest. One of the upper switchbacks opens to a rocky slope with views of Rainier. At the top of the ridge, a trail to the north follows the ridgeline up to Earl Peak. Continue down the ridge on the other side to reach the Standup Trail. \r\n\nThe trail is very clear with good walking surfaces, though it is steep in parts. While it is pleasant enough in late summer, the best time is wildflower season. The trails up to Bean and Earl are very steep, with loose rock. Both require some scrambling to reach the summits. But the views from atop, or even just the near top, are well worth it.", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7062452/looking-across-the-bean-creek-basin-with-mt-stuart-behind-bean-peak", "ratings": {"rating": 4.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 2.7, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [6156, 3973], "alt-change": [2184, 369], "avg-grade": 18.0, "max-grade": 44.0}},

The trail starts by heading through the trees, straight to Little Wenatchee River, which is more of a creek than a river at this point. On a low bluff, overlooking the river, the trail then bends right/west-northwest to follow the river upstream along its forested banks.\r\n\nContinuing up stream, the trail gently climbs with short, more obvious ups and downs in places. Sometimes the trail is right next to the river, and in other places it is off to the right/north away from the river in the beautiful fir forest.  Although the trail is above the river for its entire length, the place where the river is in its gorge is from about the 1.1 mile mark to the 1.7 mile mark. Here the views of the river through the trees are more dramatic as it flows deep in its gorge below. There is a small waterfall on the south side if one looks carefully. A few overlooks along the gorge provide good viewing points.\r\n\nAt about the 1.7 mile mark the trail turns sharply to the right/northeast and heads uphill.  Almost immediately a fire road style path is encountered.  Go right/east here to come to where the trail exits onto FSR 65 a little over a mile west of Lake Creek Campground.", "features": "River/Creek \u00b7 Waterfall", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7079636/little-wenatchee-river-in-its-gorge-seen-from-the-north-side-of-the-river", "ratings": {"rating": 4.5, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 1.7, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [2470, 2242], "alt-change": [340, 148], "avg-grade": 5.0, "max-grade": 24.0}},

However, there is no sign to show exactly where this is.\r\n\nFrom its start in the fir forest on the ridge top, Little Wenatchee Ridge Trail follows the ridge line northwest as it climbs to the Poe Mountain summit that is a high point on this ridge.  Most of this climb is gradual however there are a few short, steep stretches.  Slopes of the ridge clearly drop off on each side of the trail, although the ridge top is easily wide enough for the trail and the dropoffs aren't so steep as to invoke fear.  In other words one definitely knows they are on a ridge top and can enjoy it without worry.\r\n\nHeading toward Poe Mountain, the trees begin to thin revealing snowy mountain views into the far distance to the southwest.  On a clear day Mt. Rainier, 14,411 ft., can be seen.  Soon the trees give way to grassy, high meadows with beautiful summer wildflowers. The now unobstructed views are even more awesome on both sides of the trail - left/southwest and right/northeast.  To the right is a vast panorama of nearby mountains.  On the left, the Little Wenatchee River is nearby in the valley below, and the mountains start across this valley.\r\n\nAt about the 1.2 mile mark the trail makes a short, very steep climb to a nice lookout point.  Besides the views to the southwest and northeast, there is a good view down the ridgeline here and plenty of places to sit and admire these views.\r\n\nContinuing on, Little Wenatchee Ridge Trail reaches a trail junction with Poe Mountain Trail at the 1.9 mile mark. However, the trail sign here only points to Irving Pass and Poe Mountain.  There is no arrow to Poe Mountain Trail that just climbed up to this junction to join Little Wenatchee Ridge Trail for the final push to the Poe Mountain summit.  Bear right at this trail junction to circle around and climb to the summit over the next few hundred feet.\r\n\nA the summit there are awesome views in all directions - nearby mountains to the northeast, the ridgeline of this hike to the southeast, the Little Wenatchee River valley and distant mountains including Mt.

The crossing of Cougar Creek at the half-mile point will probably result in wet boots and socks--no obvious dry route across.

It starts with a brief descent, and a climb and descent in the middle of the hike. There is a great stop for a break at 3.5 miles in with a beautiful view. During dry summers, make sure to have extra water, or be prepared to search it out and filter from small pools.  \r\n\nFor the most part, the trail crawls lazily to Arch Rock.

It appears some people cut this first switchback by shooting straight from the sign to the ridge - stay the trail. In the summer, the trail will pass through super-green undergrowth. \r\n\nAs of July 2017, from the moment you enter the wilderness area we started to encounter a ton of tree fall, which either makes hiking annoying or interactive depending on your preference. Some spots along the first half-mile of wilderness also suffered from erosion. Higher up the trail was in better condition. By the time you get to the steady switchbacks, about 1.5 miles in, the trail is great and the only remaining tree fall consists of massive logs rather than brush. \r\n\nThere is a great viewpoint at about a third of a mile in, and then after that the trail never quite opens up for the views that you'd hope for. You'll never actually see Bumping Lake from above either. However, the forest it heads through is beautiful and includes some massive old-growth trees. Aside from the roughly 0.5 miles of trail at the bottom of the wilderness, the trail is beautiful and never steep. The gradual nature of the trail makes it surprisingly easy going.", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7034425/flowers-alongside-the-goose-prairie-trail", "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 5.4, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [5952, 3370], "alt-change": [2582, 77], "avg-grade": 9.0, "max-grade": 25.0}},

The start of the trail is not well marked, but is near a wooden bridge on American Ridge trail just a few hundred feet passed the intersection with Swamp Lake Trail. \r\n\nAccess to this trail is via two routes: \r\nThe shortest approach is via Swamp Lake Trailhead on Rd 1800 from Bumping River Road, then 4.6 miles on the Swamp Lake Trail until it intersects American Ridge Trail\r\nThe second option is via Chinook Pass, then Pacific Crest Trail (6.6 miles) to American Ridge Trail (1.4 miles). Trail itself climbs steadily on the first portion, then steep descent into the lake basin. \r\n\nFirst lake you'll see is Little Cougar Lake which has a great, accessible shoreline. Access to Cougar Lake is by continuing on the trail which crosses the isthmus between the lakes. Cougar Lake is much larger, but more difficult approaches to the shore. Trail itself doesn't really have any highlights but the sight of Little Cougar is very welcome after the steep descent.

The trail begins by turning north three miles into the Snoqualmie Lake Trail, about 60 feet before the first falls and bridge. The trail is difficult to follow as there are a ton of fallen trees, making the trail seem nonexistent in places. GPS is recommended here as there are many offshoots and dead ends. The trail is also marked loosely with pink ribbons tied around branches, keep a look out for them. After 0.5 miles the trail leaves the forest and opens into an overgrown meadow rife with Bunchberry flowers and Devil's Stick stalks with plenty of thorns. \r\n\nThe trail is singletrack here, but if you turn around you'll see amazing views of Treen Peak. Long pants and sleeves are recommended. The meadows eventually close in to more forested cover with plenty of mud and micro water falls, again marked with pink ribbons. Expect near 40 degree terrain around mile 0.9, using tree roots to climb upwards after the meadow. The final push is relaxed as the last 0.1 of a mile strolls through a very small boulder field and can be navigated with GPS and the pink ribbons. The trail finally dumps into a small clearing just east of Marten Lake, with absolute phenomenal views of Rooster Mountain to the west which are reflected in Marten Lake on a calm day. Once in the clearing on the right side of the large downed tree separating you from the lake, there's a small trail that goes down to the waters edge.\r\n\nThe descent should be taken cautiously especially after a good rain, as it can be very slippery. There are several offshoots of the trail that lead to dead ends on descent. Once passed the meadow there are seemingly two trails that are intertwined that aren't noticed when heading up. Pink ribbons seem to mark both of these trails, and as long as you run in to the Snoqualmie Lake Trail at the bottom you'll know to head right and find your car.", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7070119/marten-lake", "ratings": {"rating": 4.3, "num_reviewers": 4}, "stats": {"dist": 1.1, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [3108, 1815], "alt-change": [1293, 0], "avg-grade": 22.0, "max-grade": 41.0}},

It then follows Grizzly Bear Ridge out, alternating between woods and open meadow and staying just below the ridge line. \r\n\nIt then switchbacks down to the river bottom and runs parallel to Rock Creek before intersecting the Wenaha River Trail. This entire area was burned in the 2015 Grizzly Bear Complex fire and there are lots of standing dead snags with more coming down all the time. The last mile of trail has not seen much maintenance or travel, so head high brush and deadfalls await. \r\n\nChoose camping areas wisely.  At the bottom, proceed left and find several campsites.\r\n\nWater can be found in Rock Creek or the Wenaha River though Forest Service map indicates two springs not far off the trail on the way down.", "features": "Fishing \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7062795/view-from-the-switchbacks-towards-the-end-of-the-trail", "ratings": {"rating": 4.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 8.0, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [5425, 2552], "alt-change": [206, 3079], "avg-grade": 8.0, "max-grade": 30.0}},

Go right/north here to hike Cady Ridge Trail.\r\n\nImmediately, in the fir forest, Cady Ridge Trail starts climbing up the end of Cady Ridge close to where Cady Creek empties into the Little Wenatchee River.  For the first 1.4 miles this climb is on civilized switchbacks slightly to the Cady Creek side (south side) of the ridgeline.  Still in the forest at the 1.4 mile mark, the trail is done switchbacking as it steeply heads straight up the ridgeline for the next 600 feet of the climb. \r\n\nThen at about the 1.9 mile mark the grade eases as the trail finishes the remaining 0.8 miles of the climb by traversing the Cady Creek side of the ridge as it angles its way to the ridge top that it reaches at the 2.7 mile mark.  This climb is entirely in the fir forest with occasional glimpses of nearby peaks, until the very end when the trail pops out into meadows and a surprise view of snowy Glacier Peak, 10.541 ft., to the north.\r\n\nFrom the 2.7 mile mark, Cady Ridge Trail, with small ups and downs, ambles along the ridge top through grassy meadows with wildflowers and occasional snow patches (in July), and short forested stretches.  Seen to the northeast is Poets Ridge with the Little Wenatchee River in the valley below, separating these two ridges.  And to the southwest the nearby Cady Creek Valley separates Cady Ridge from another unnamed ridge.\r\n\nAt about the 4.5 mile mark Cady Ridge Trail moves to the southwest slightly below the ridgetop. Continuing on in the meadows the trail passes a couple small streams and begins a very gradual descent.  The trail soon finds itself on a small bluff overlooking a valley ahead with the PCT in it.  Cady Ridge Trail descends into this valley to end at a trail junction with the PCT.", "features": "Commonly Backpacked \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7023879/crystal-clear-view-of-the-night-sky-from-the-campsite-upon-cady-ridge", "ratings": {"rating": 5.0, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 6.0, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [5551, 3108], "alt-change": [3123, 891], "avg-grade": 13.0, "max-grade": 89.0}},

One sign points to Blue Lake. Follow this arrow to Blue Lake, to hike Blue Lake High Trail.  Do NOT follow the sign pointing to Bald Eagle Trail and the PCT, as its arrows take one the long way around to the PCT, avoiding the direct Blue Lake High Trail. From this trail junction, Blue Lake High Trail begins in the trees with a steep rocky, rooty climb along the Blue Lake outlet creek, on its north side. After about a tenth of a mile, the trail breaks out of the trees and becomes flat as it continues along the creek to arrive at Blue Lake, a scenic, popular place to camp.\r\n\nAt Blue Lake there are many side trails. To pass Blue Lake, cross the lake's outlet creek near the lake and continue along the lake's open grassy southwest shoreline.  Blue Lake High Trail then leaves the lake behind to immediately climb a couple short switchbacks and then directly head up a steep open area revealing great views of the lake and Johnson Mountain.\r\n\nContinuing on, the trail now angles up the steep ridge it will go over.  The meadows thin and become rather rocky, as the trail heads higher towards its summit on a knife edge ridge.  To the left/northeast the ridge rises steeply, and to the right/southwest, the ridge drops off sharply.  Climbing the steep sided ridge, some loose talus stretches are also encountered just to keep things interesting.  Close to the ridge summit there are a couple steep but welcome switchbacks, and then suddenly, after a bit over half a mile of steep climbing, the knife edge ridge top is reached.  There are some great rocks to sit on here and admire the views.\r\n\nFollowing a rest at the summit, the trail heads almost directly down the steep, loose, rocky east side of the summit.  After a tenth of a mile the descent becomes less steep, as the trail now angles down the ridge.  Soon the trail angle is almost at a contour line and although the slopes are steep, the descent eases substantially, as one finds themself in grassy meadows with wildflowers. An unmarked trail junction with Bald Eagle Trail #650 is soon reached where Blue Lake High Trail ends.", "features": "Commonly Backpacked \u00b7 Lake \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7061052/blue-lake-and-johnson-mountain", "ratings": {"rating": 4.0, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 1.3, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [6259, 5496], "alt-change": [763, 520], "avg-grade": 18.0, "max-grade": 43.0}},

From Blue Lake, head west and turn right onto Pilot Ridge Trail #652.  Johnson Mountain Trail is then found at a well marked trail junction after hiking about a mile along Pilot Ridge Trail #652.\r\n\nJohnson Mountain Trail climbs continuously traversing grassy meadows on the very steep slopes of Johnson Mountain.  From the very beginning to the end, there are awesome views in all directions. Be careful to not get so distracted by the views that you make a mis-step and fall off the mountain - it is very steep and a fall would not end well.  Snowy mountains are everywhere into the far distance.  \r\n\nOther nearby green ridges covered with grassy meadows and forests stretch out dramatically in all directions, most notable is Pilot Ridge to the northwest.  Several creek/river drainages branch out below from their sources.  Blue Lake is right there, far below, and Little Blue Lake can be seen nearby.  If you are planning to hike Blue Lake High Trail #652.1 you can get a look at it to the southeast on the far side of Blue Lake, as it traces its way up to its knife edge summit. Fun to bring a map for your rest breaks and enjoy identifying the surrounding topography :>)\r\n\nAfter winding around on the grassy slopes for about a half mile, Johnson Mountain Trail makes a U-turn at an awesome overlook, and heads for the summit block, a rocky outcropping. The trail is soon right below the rock outcropping, but still with meadows dropping away to the left/south. Then abruptly the trail comes to a very short (a few feet) place where rock climbing skills and nerves of steel are needed to continue. \r\n\nOne can see more reasonable trail on the other side of this gap, but this is where this trail description ends. There is only about another 100 meters on the other side of the gap to the summit, but the gap takes the hike to another level, double black diamond. And it is hard to imagine, one would get any new views by going the last 100m to the summit.

There is a small information board but no fee box, so make sure you have a Discovery Pass or day pass with you. You'll enter the wilderness area, so be sure to fill out the registration form. \r\n\nThe trail begins from the parking area by climbing up a set of smooth, gentle switchbacks into the dense forest. You'll gain about 300 feet and should look for the Viewpoint Spur. A large rock outcropping on the left side of the trail before the Viewpoint Spur can help you see it on the way in. However, it's very hard to see on the way in, as the trail leads back towards you and is unsigned. There is a wooden sign on a large tree on the way out, so if you miss it no worries, you'll find it later. It's about 100 feet up some rocks to a lovely view of the valley and Mount David. \r\n\nAfter the spur, the trail will descend a bit, and offers a few nice views to the surrounding mountains en route to a small pond/over-grown swamp where the Twin Lakes Creek meets the Napeeque River. You'll follow the southern edge of the pond, cross the Twin Lakes Creek, and then begin the trail's climb. This section is steeper and rockier, but not bad. Some switchbacks help, and occasional views of Twin Lakes Creek keep it somewhat interesting. \r\n\nFinally, the trail will level out at the first of the Twin Lakes with great valley views across it, including Dirtyface Peak. The trail continues along the northeastern edge of the lake. It is flat going along this section. It officially terminates at a log dam at the end of the second of Twin Lakes, but you can continue on informal trails or hang out on the logs before returning the way you came.", "features": "Fall Colors \u00b7 Lake \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7053051/lots-of-fall-colors-along-the-trail", "ratings": {"rating": 3.7, "num_reviewers": 3}, "stats": {"dist": 3.3, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [2932, 1968], "alt-change": [1213, 296], "avg-grade": 9.0, "max-grade": 30.0}},

Near the intersection there is a horse camp and it's big.  We stopped here for lunch and continued on the Tungsten trail. I heard or read that miners used this route to supply workers, goods and food to those working at the tungsten mine, and that this was the main route for moving the mineral out as well. Due to the industrial past of the area, the trail goes up and without the benefit of switchbacks.  \r\n\nOn parts of this trail you get a really closed in feeling, especially when its quiet. Trees and other local flora grow and sometimes overgrow the trail. We spotted a Spruce Grouse that flew across the trail and landed in a nearby tree.  We heard the bird before we saw it.  \r\n\nIf you started at the Thirtymile trailhead and plan to end somewhere in the vicinity of the Tungsten mine, the last part of this long trip seems to be the steepest.

The trail follows along the Chewuch River for 18 gentle miles. The route is almost always beautiful, and depending on the time of the year, the aspens might be in peak color, with their gold and yellow leaves contrasting starkly with the openness of the terrain. That openness is a result of a forest fire.  \r\n\nAlong the first portion of the trail there are a number of places to camp, one of which is by Chewuch Falls. If your destination is further along the way, the Falls are a great stop for lunch. We saw a few campers there on the way back. There are also a couple of horse camps off the trail but I wouldn't recommend them. Near the intersection of the Tungsten Trail, there is a horse camp which is a good place to stop for lunch or snacks. At this point you can merge on the Tungsten Trail or continue on the Chewuch.  \r\n\nOnce you reach the end of the trail, you'll have the option to complete various loops, or head back the way that you came. Be aware that it is a long haul back to the Thirtymile Trailhead, so you may want to break this up over multiple days. You could stop at one of the stops mentioned above in the first part of the trail or camp at Four Point Lake which is off the Coleman Ridge Trail. Since you are in a river valley surrounded by mountains the camp options are limited.  \r\n\nPortions of this part of the trail are littered with rocks that makes navigation less than fun, especially on the downhill, and tough on the feet. This is also a popular horse trail for hunters so be prepared for that during hunting season.  \r\n\nThe reverse portion of the trail for the Tungsten Trail intersection back to Thirtymile Trailhead offers you some different views from the journey out.

It climbs 1,000 feet per mile through a shaded forest and then breaks out near an open ridge among a fantastic display of wildflowers (mid-late July). On the ridge top (before mile 4 where the trail turns north), you'll find a camp with no water available. However, about half way up, you'll find a spring, but it may not be a reliable source as the summer progresses on. \r\n\nUpon reaching the summit, you'll be rewarded with views of Little Jackass Mountain, Hozomeen Mountain, Skagit Peak, Nohokomeen Glacier, and the lovely fjord-like Ross Lake.

The trailhead can be accessed via a water taxi that leaves from near Ross Dam which can be accessed from the Ross Dam Trail. Make sure to call ahead for reservations! You can find more information about the water taxi service here ( rosslakeresort.com/transpor\u2026). \r\n\nFrom the dock on Ross Lake, the trail immediately climbs through an evergreen forest for the first mile. The trail descends briefly, then flattens while gradually ascending with some minor downhills along the canyon of Little Beaver Creek. The trail passes through some brushy meadows where the brush can stand over six feet tall. In this section, the trail passes over a couple creeks, some requiring you to ford the waters by removing your boots. \r\n\nAt 4.6 miles you pass Perry Creek Campground which is located just to the east of Perry Creek. Continue through more brushy meadows along Little Beaver Creek. This part of the trail offers a few views out from the valley floor, but the best views are still to come.\r\n\nAt 10.5 miles, the Big Beaver Trail forks off to the left. This trail leads to Stillwell Campground and up to Beaver Pass. The main Little Beaver trail continues to the west up the valley. \r\n\nAfter another 3.5 miles,  you'll pass Twin Rocks Camp. The trail then starts ascending more steadily. This part of the trail can be very brushy and can really slow down your progress. Wearing long pants can help preserve your legs from getting scratched up, as the trail can be quite overgrown. \r\n\nAs you get closer to the head of the valley, the trail passes beautiful waterfalls cascading down the cliffs on the south side of the valley. Look south to see Mount Challenger and Whatcom Peak with their glaciers spilling into the valley. The views only get better from here. The trail ascends steeply up switchbacks through a forest of large firs with views out to large, gnarly peaks.  \r\n\nOnce you've made your way to Whatcom Pass, take in the views of Whatcom Peak, Easy Peak, Mount Challenger and many more jagged peaks in the heart of the North Cascade range. From here, you can continue onto Brush Creek and Whatcom Pass Campground, or climb up to Tapto Lakes.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Waterfall \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "ratings": {"rating": 3.5, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 17.4, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [5197, 1648], "alt-change": [4881, 1332], "avg-grade": 7.0, "max-grade": 51.0}},

A few peek-a-boos offer quick glimpses of the lake and dam as you get closer to the bottom of the trail. \r\n\nWhen you reach the bottom of the trail, you'll encounter a gravel road, and you're almost there! Turn right on the gravel road for a view of the lake and access to the ferry for the Ross Lake Resort. By taking a left onto the gravel road and following the signs another 0.3 miles, you can work your way out onto the dam for an amazing view of Ross Lake and Jack Mountain. For a longer outing, continue across the dam to meet up with the West Bank/Big Beaver Trail.

Day users commonly use this first section of the trail. The trail starts in fir forests and follows the shore of Diablo Lake for 0.7 miles to where Thunder Creek empties into Diablo Lake.

This trail can be done as a long, demanding out-and-back to either the summit or the road on the north side or as a one-way with a shuttle. Note, however, that road access to the northern trailhead may require a 4WD vehicle and will require a current forest road map. There are few campsites or water sources along this trail; water sources may be non-existent by late summer.\r\n\nThe #4407 starts at the Dog Mountain Trailhead and climbs around the west slope of Dog Mountain for 2.8 miles to a junction with the Dog-Augspurger Tie Trail. This stretch of trail offers great views of the Columbia River Gorge to the west. From this junction, the #4407 descends the ridge to an old road - now decommissioned - in the bottom of the drainage. Turn right (east) here and follow the old road to an intersection of service roads under a powerline. Follow the service road that heads northeast and within 500 feet or so you'll reach a continuation of the #4407 on the right.\r\n\nFrom the service road, follow the #4407 as it climbs to the top of a ridge with eye-level views of the powerlines and big views of the Columbia River beyond. From this open ground, the trail continues directly up the ridge, never veering far from its crest. This section can get over-grown so pay attention to avoid losing the sometimes faint tread. There are occasional views from along this ridge.\r\n\nAt just under six miles from the trailhead, and after roughly 3,600 feet of gain, the trail will turn to the northeast across a shallow saddle and soon thereafter you'll reach the wooded, viewless summit of Augspurger Mountain. If you plan to turn-back from here, it's worth it to go a little further north on the trail to where there are some views.\r\n\nContinuing on from Augspurger summit, the #4407 descends the mountain's north-northwest ridge, never veering too far from its crest. This is a less-used section of trail and can get deeply overgrown, so pay close attention to avoid losing the sometimes obscure tread. At about 0.9 miles from the summit, the trail makes a sharp turn to the right (east) off the ridge, then a sharp turn to the left (north) to avoid some rock outcroppings on the ridge.

Look for a old forest road at a fork on the right: this is where the trail begins. The trail will follow some gentle old farm roads through meadows along switchbacks before entering forest. From here the trail will continue a steady climb on easy to follow old road until you come to an intersection at about 1.8 miles. This intersection begins the loop part of the lollipop. \r\n\nNote: You can follow the faint trail straight ahead (east) and do the loop counterclockwise which is recommended if the trail appears faint or it's likely to be overgrown in the summer (this is how this description is mapped). The trail part can be difficult to follow and going counterclockwise will help you navigate it back to the road section. However, it should be noted that the western half of the loop along the old road is not very good hiking - it's pretty boring really - so you may want to do that part first! It would also be shorter to do Cook Hill as an out-and-back to save some time/distance but then you'd miss the Adams views from the power lines. \r\n\nFrom the intersection head east on the narrow foot path. You'll shortly enter mossier forest than the road up passed through and then enter a meadow in about 2.1 miles. These meadows can be covered with balsamroot in spring. Re-enter the forest and follow the trail onto the SE ridge of Cook Hill. From here the trail is very steep! Eventually you'll exit the forest into the upper wildflower-filled meadow which signifies you're close to the summit. The summit is wide open to the south offering great views of Mt Hood, Mt Defiance, and Dog Mountain (which is slightly lower than this summit) but there aren't views north. \r\n\nHead down from the summit on a steep descent that soon turns into a mellow old forest road. Follow this to a radio tower, pass around the tower, and take the utility road to the power lines. From here a great view of Adams can be had and the Tin Can Trail can be found. Look for another old road to the south that heads back into the forest. Follow this road all the way back to the intersection where the trail \"ends\" and then continue the remaining 1.8 miles to Jackson Road.  \r\n\nIn total this hike is about 8.15 miles round trip counting the road, and nearly 3,000 of gain to a 3,015 foot high summit.", "features": "Views \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7077284/views-of-columbia-gorge", "ratings": {"rating": 4.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 5.8, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [2992, 256], "alt-change": [2820, 1281], "avg-grade": 13.0, "max-grade": 40.0}},

The road was the idea of Sam Hill, whose vast properties in nearby Maryhill warrant a day's worth of investigations. \r\n\nHill's futile efforts to persuade the Washington legislature to fund a river road running east from Vancouver resulted in his attention turning towards Oregon.

Since 2015, volunteers and land trust staff have been working to eradicate invasive yellow starthistle here.\r\n\nOn the main trail, keep climbing. Notice the round river pebbles on the trail. They were deposited by the Missoula Floods. As water repeatedly breached glacial ice dams in western Montana 12,000 to 17,000 years ago, glacial outburst floods resulted. \r\n\nThese walls of water roared westward along the route of the Columbia River, scouring hillsides into cliffs.

The most logical/common way to use this trail is in combination with Cook Hill Loop which results in around 4,500 ft of gain and 13 miles round trip. You'll be rewarded with near-solitude and excellent views of Adams, Hood, the Gorge, and okay views of Helens. Rainier largely remains hidden behind Lemei Peak. \r\n\nTo get to the the primary start of this route, climb Cook Hill Loop to it's northern point under the electrical lines. Look for the large transmission tower surrounded by a black chain-link fence to the northwest (the higher/right-hand of two short service drives). The trail follows the southwest/left-hand edge of the chain-link fence and then passes through some young pines before entering the forest. From here the trail should be easier to follow: keep an eye on the dirt singletrack and an eye on the trees ahead for the next tin can lid. \r\n\nIn about half a mile you'll come to a knob along the ridge that offers wonderful unobstructed views of Mount Adams. After this knob the trail descends slightly and stays a little to the southwest/left of the ridge top. In another quarter of a mile you'll enter a small meadow with Hood views, reenter the forest and emerge onto an open ridge-top meadow again at just over a mile form the start. This ridge offers outstanding views of Mount Hood. \r\n\nYou'll go back in the woods and begin a gradual ascent up the eastern face of Augspurger. Parts of this section are likely to be overgrown and difficult to follow in summer. Finally at about 1.5 miles you'll enter another meadow with okay views. look for the protruding knob on the north side of the ridge. It offers nice views of Adams and Indian Heaven. The trail drops a little before quickly getting steep as you make the push up Augspurger. You'll be in the forest for the remainder of the trail which eventually ends at Augspurger Trail #4407.

There are a multitude of other trails near the beginning and a few other viewpoints accessible closer to the top. To get this trail you'll have to drive to the end of Smith-Cripe Road to a turnaround with parking for a good number of cars. \r\n\nFrom there start up the unmarked doubletrack (formerly Forest Road 1853) past a gate and into a meadow. Before you exit the meadow on the north side look for a clear trail on your right with an overgrown sign. This is the beginning of Archer Mountain Trail. Continuing on the doubletrack will take you into \"High Valley\" a former hippie commune with a mess of other informal trails. \r\n\nFrom the doubletrack pass through a blackberry thicket and into the woods. Where the trail forks keep to the right and head downhill. A large tree at this fork had a bright blue blaze on it. The trail will switchback down hill for a way until it reaches Archer Creek. A clever bridge of logs with a unique handrail makes crossing easy. After this, the trail will begin a gradual ascent, which quickly becomes a very steep ascent. Numerous small switchbacks help with the ascent but be mindful of the fist-sized scree that much of the trail is comprised of. \r\n\nThe forest will begin to open up as you climb resulting in lovely views of the valley, gorge, and Cape Horn. One of the best viewpoints is a small rocky and mossy point with a lone Douglas fir at the end. Continue climbing until the trail moderates a little at an intersection with a spur to Scott Point. From this viewpoint, you can see ~220 foot Archer Falls in the wet months, but it's dry in the summer. \r\n\nContinue climbing past an old road that heads north into the closed-off Columbia Falls Natural Area Preserve. You'll soon pass another trail intersection signed as Quiver Trail which leads to Arrow Point. Hereafter the trail is less maintained as you make the final push for the summit. The summit does not have any views, so many hikers choose to hikef to Arrow Point, but that route has become excessively overgrown with raspberries and dangerous giant hogweed.

This trail has a unique feature in which there is a parking lot at each side of the trail, and both show off the majesty of Snoqualmie Falls and the Salish Lodge. If you are a fan of Twin Peaks, these falls are featured in the intro on every episode. Here's your chance to see it up close and personal.\r\n\n- Arriving\r\nTo get to the trailhead from Seattle, head east on I-90, and take the Snoqualmie Parkway exit. Railroad Ave. will drive right by Salish lodge and the parking lot. Park next to Salish lodge if arriving from this direction. This area is fairly populated, so expect lots of visitors to the Falls especially on sunny days. We found parking fairly easily despite the place being packed.\r\n\n- Top Observation Deck\r\nFrom the parking lot, it's less than a mile to views of the Falls! It's hard to miss the thronging crowd of people, or even the sound of the falls thundering just beyond. The best views of the Falls themselves can be had here. There's also a gift shop nearby, and of course the Salish Lodge.\r\n\n- Lower Observation Deck\r\nThe Lower Observation Deck is accessible from SE Fish Hatchery Rd. From the main parking lot, drive north, and turn left on Fish Hatchery. This deck offers no direct view of the Falls but is from river level below. Hydroelectric machinery blocks some area.\r\n\n- Accessing the Trail\r\nTo get on the actual trail, head away from the falls, parallel to the parking lot, and you'll see the boardwalk head downhill. This is the beginning of the trail. Please note this trail has a fairly steep grade. It's doable by anyone in proper shape with no injuries, including children, but is quite difficult otherwise. I'm injured and overweight and I was only able to hike down the trail, not back up it (without a bunch of rest). This trail leads to the Lower Observation Deck, which has it's own parking lot, accessible to anyone.\r\n\n- Trail Characteristics\r\nFrom the Top Observation Deck, the trail is all downhill at ~10% or more grade. In-shape families with children should be fine, others beware! Elevation change ~150-200ft. This trail is comprised of multiple, long switchbacks, with a wide trail and gravel in some areas.

The trail is very flat and lacks any substantial obstacles. The abundant Columbia River Basalt is ever-present along the trail, providing some rocky area, but not overwhelmingly so. Eventually, the trail morphs back into doubletrack, save for a few short stretches of singletrack before it reaches the town of Klickitat. \r\n\nThe trail can be very beautiful to experience in the spring, as the hills come alive with a vibrant green and the rapids of the Klickitat River swell with snowmelt. It can also be pleasant in the warmer months, as the trail traverses underneath both open sky and forest canopy.  \r\n\nOne great rest stop is about four miles in where you head towards the river where a small sandbar is. You can dip your feet in the water here (very shallow) and continue on your way. Great on a hot summer day.\r\n\nThis route terminates at the town of Klickitat. A washed-out bridge a mile east of Klickitat formerly connected the entirety of the 31-mile trail; however now one must hike on State Road 142 for about three miles to reach the Wahkiacus Trailhead.

Especially lower down, the trail will be quite narrow in a few places. Most of the time you'll enjoy a long sight line, but be aware that this is a multi-use trail and cyclists may be making their way downhill quickly. Though hikers have the right of way, it's best to stay alert to avoid mishap.\r\n\nAs you continue past dense salal, enjoy the greenery as the trail continues it's tough ascent. You'll get a short break from the steep climbing every now and again, so take advantage of these portions to stop and appreciate the forested views behind and around you (as well as to catch your breath!).

Adams, Rainier, and Stuart visible on clear days. It is in open shrub-steppe terrain moving from sagebrush to open grasslands.\r\n\nCandy Mountain Preserve is a new 195-acre Benton County park south of West Richland, Washington. The preserve starts low in a collection of 5 acre parcels then continues up to the 1391 foot summit of Candy Mountain, including all of the east face. The trail leads to the summit and was completed in December of 2016. It starts from a parking lot off of private road East 669PR NE, near the Dallas Rd I-82 overpass. The spacious lot has room for at least 45 vehicles and a few horse trailers. There is a portable toilet only at the parking lot and trash service and water are not available anywhere on the trail.  Bring plenty of water and pack out your trash, including your dog's poo.\r\n\nThe trail is wide and surfaced with gravel. Please stay on the trail and do not cut the curves. The trail is popular with hikers, trail runners and mountain bikers, but there is ample room to allow passing without leaving the trail.\r\n\nThe trail starts out easy, gaining only 60 feet in the first half mile. It leaves the parking lot on a converted road, crosses a private road twice, and then skirts it again before entering into the preserve proper. Here it wanders past some boulders as it crosses and then follows the ridge top with views to the north. At a half mile the trail transitions to a steady 10% grade to the summit. Just after the first access road crossing is a boulder that marks the maximum elevation of Lake Lewis, the temporary lake created during the Ice Age Flood, see iafi.org for more information. The rest of the boulders along the trail were removed during construction. \r\n\nThe trail ends at the summit. The five acres of the summit is private land the owners are kindly letting the public use. Please do not disturb their antenna facility. You need to reverse your course to return to the parking lot.\r\n\nThis trail is another piece of an envisioned 20 mile long trail system that would connect Red Mountain to Claybell Park below Little Badger and includes the 4 trails on Badger Mountain.

Your views are expansive right from the start as you traverse the top of a ridge. Mounts Hood, Adams, St. Helens, and Rainier are usually clearly visible at some point on your journey. In season, this ridge is alive with a multitude of different wildflowers.\r\n\nAfter about 1.5 miles, the old road fades into a singletrack trail which makes its way down to a saddle between \u201cHowie\u201d (Point 3740) and Bluff Mountain. This is the low point of your hike. From here, you\u2019ll start a gradual climb along the cliffs on the west side of Bluff Mountain, through a bit of forest, to, at 3.5 miles, a saddle between Bluff Mountain and Little Baldy. This will be where you get your first full view of the steep east side of Silver Star Mountain to the west.\r\n\nFrom this saddle, you'll traverse below Little Baldy on its left (west) side, since the trail does not cross its summit. The Yacolt Burn, the massive forest fire that devastated this whole area back in 1902, is the reason that all these peaks remain bald and devoid of much vegetation.\r\n\nAt a little over 5 miles, you reach a junction with the rugged, steep Starway Trail #175. From here, it\u2019s about 0.8 miles and 700 feet to Silver Star\u2019s summit. As that comes more sharply into view, the trail starts to run along the top of a narrow spine, with numerous basaltic outcrops.\r\n\nThe Bluff Mountain Trail #172 actually by-passes the summit to end at a junction with the Silver Star Trail #180. To continue to the summit, make a sharp left (south) turn here and hike up the rocky closed road for 0.2 miles to another old road junction, turn left (east) again, and head up an even rockier road (Silver Star Summit Trail #180D) to the top.", "features": "Fall Colors \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildflowers", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7042023/little-baldy-left-and-silver-star-from-howie", "ratings": {"rating": 4.8, "num_reviewers": 4}, "stats": {"dist": 6.4, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [4145, 3135], "alt-change": [1404, 830], "avg-grade": 7.0, "max-grade": 24.0}},

If in doubt about the gate, park on Forest Road 41 and hike down to the creek. There are no amenities at this trailhead.\r\n\nFrom the trailhead on Forest Road 41, descend Forest Road 4107 to Copper Creek, cross the very solidly constructed bridge, turn left (upstream, east) and continue on Forest Road 4107. At 0.25 miles past the bridge, you\u2019ll reach a junction with the Starway Trail #175. It leaves the old roadbed and climbs very steeply to the west up the side of the ridge on a rough old mining \"road\". The trail follows this old road upward to the ridge at about 2,600 feet where the road ends and the grade eases a bit.\r\n\nAbout two miles from the trailhead (around 3,200 feet), you\u2019ll pass the collapsed remnants of a crudely constructed shelter \u2013 just logs and plastic tarps in a pile. Your first chance for a view comes about 0.25 miles past this old shelter.\r\n\nPast the shelter, the trail degrades into little more than an often hard to discern use trail. It is not too difficult to follow as the tread can be seen from time to time and pink ribbons (and a few cairns) here and there provide routing hints. HOWEVER, if you are uncomfortable hiking without a clearly discernible trail and aren't solid on navigation, this would be a good place to turn back. \n\nIf you press on, the trail continues along the ridge southward for two miles, passing over Point 3977, dropping to a saddle, then ascending to end at its junction with the Bluff Mountain Trail #172 less than a mile east of Silver Star Mountain.

The trail follows a creek, which you can see for most of the hike, and has plenty of beautiful views of small rapids and waterfalls. The steepest part of the trail has wood-rimmed dirt stairs with a wooden railing for assistance if needed.\r\n\nAt the bottom of the hill, the trail turns to pavement, and you pass a ranger\u2019s house, a little free library box, some nice pavilions and picnic tables, port-o-potties, and a bit of a frisbee golf setup. There are two really nice beaches at the bottom (each separated by the small creek running down to the Sound). \r\n\nAt the bottom, you have to hike under the railroad tracks through a short and narrow/low-ceilinged tunnel with metal grates for the floor to reach the beaches (the tunnel goes right over the mouth of the creek). I saw some people fishing there, and some playing with their dogs off-leash (although everyone had their dogs leashes on the actual trail). After exiting the tunnel, there is a rocky beach to your right and a softer sand beach to your left. \r\n\nDepending on the weather and day you go, it could be fairly crowded or rather isolated. The beach to the right is a great place for bird watching, and maybe you'll see some marine life, too (there was an informational sign about seals on one beach). Both beaches have a fantastic view of the Olympics, so it is a perfect place to just lounge on the beach.\r\n\nApart from it being a fairly popular trail on nice weekends, this is one of the closest trails I have found in the Lynnwood/Everett/Edmonds area that feels like you\u2019ve left behind civilization without leaving your city and without driving all the way out into the Cascades.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7044055/view-from-one-of-the-puget-sound-beaches-with-a-great-view-of-the-olympics", "ratings": {"rating": 4.5, "num_reviewers": 8}, "stats": {"dist": 1.2, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [474, 4], "alt-change": [45, 483], "avg-grade": 8.0, "max-grade": 31.0}},

Though steep, the trail is well maintained and free of obstacles. At about 1 mile,  you'll come to an unmarked intersection. Both trails lead to the ridge. However, the right trail is the official trail. The Forest Service has closed the left trail, so do not use it. \r\n\nAt about 2 miles, you'll reach an intersection near the creek. A labeled spur trail to the left leads to the ridge. This portion of the trail climbs steadily and is littered with large and old blowdowns that make moving quickly through this section challenging. Emerge from the dark forest onto the ridge. You'll be greeted with spectacular views of Kachess Lake and the mountains beyond. An old fire lookout also tops the ridge.\r\n\nIf you're looking for an extended hike, you can descend back to the intersection at Silver Creek and follow the trail up the valley into alpine meadows beyond.", "features": "River/Creek \u00b7 Views", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7051576/view-from-the-first-intersection", "ratings": {"rating": 4.5, "num_reviewers": 4}, "stats": {"dist": 12.9, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [5581, 2404], "alt-change": [4653, 2160], "avg-grade": 10.0, "max-grade": 59.0}},
