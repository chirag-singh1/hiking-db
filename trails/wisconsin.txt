Eventually, you'll emerge in a prairie, where there are some backcountry camping spots available. \r\n\nFollow the yellow blazes past the campground trail to find yourself at a very stunning overlook of Lake Wisconsin to the east/northeast. From there, you'll descend into a valley and finally meet up with Slack Road.\r\n\nTo continue to Gibraltar Rock, you'll have to take some road miles here for a while. Head down Slack Road (which, fortunately, does not have much traffic), and then take a right on Hwy V (which also has relatively low traffic volume). Once you come across Gibraltar Rock Road, you are ready to hit the dirt again.\r\n\nFollow the singletrack in the woods up a relatively long and steady climb. You'll be rewarded with some great views of Gibraltar Rock, rolling farmlands to the south and west, and Lake Wisconsin to the west. (Trivia: This view has recently become famous by being featured in the dark film \"Uncle John\" an indie film that is getting rave reviews at various film festivals around the world.) \r\n\nAfter a breathtaking visit to Gibraltar Rock, head onward, and you'll descend the terrain into some beautiful prairies that are on the western portion of the Gibraltar Rock County Park. Eventually, you'll end up at another trailhead parking lot.

While some wooden steps may slow you down, it's not likely you'd go any faster without them as the initial climb is quite steep. \r\n\nAfter finishing the steps, the trail keeps climbing through some of Wyalusing's most exceptional oak savanna habitat. The trail continues climbing, steeply, covering almost 600' of elevation in roughly 3/4 of a mile, until it gains the bluff top. \r\n\nThe trail opens up at a picnic area, which houses the famed monument to the last Wisconsin Passenger Pigeon, a testament to \"the avarice and folly of man.\" The monument, joined with an exceptional view of the Mississippi, and some oxygen debt, creates quite a profound experience.\r\n\nThe trail is briefly paved through this section, and crowds can be abundant depending on the season. But as soon as you leave the open setting of the picnic area, they tend to thin out again. Shortly after the picnic area, a spur leads users down to Treasure Cave. To descend the ridge and access the cave, the DNR has installed a series of wooden structures somewhere between ladders and steps.

However, this area in particular consists of mostly low-land which requires boardwalks in some areas and creates for swampy/muddy conditions around those boardwalks. The swampy and wet nature of the area also makes it a mosquito haven, especially during a wet season, but does however enable some interesting scenery of very moss covered trees and rocks and lots of mushrooms along the path.\r\n\nAlthough most of the segment is on Waterville road, the road is actually quite a pleasant hike with very little traffic (lots of cyclists) and a scenic drive sort of feel.\r\n\nThere is plenty of parking located near the UW Waukesha Field Station also by the Wildlife in Need Center.
