Be sure to check with the park rangers for current trail conditions as this is a very primitive setting.

If it has been wet, be prepared to spend most of the way navigating through slippery mud conditions. For about three miles, you'll work your way through coastal grasslands. You'll then head into the forest for another two miles or so before making your way back into the prairie. The trail is very flat for the entirety of the trip, but it is very exposed to the elements. \r\n\nPanther tracks are visible as you move farther into the grass and you feel like you're the only people in the world as you go farther along. You can hear many birds, but be prepared for the bugs once you enter the forest! Around 6.5 miles, there is a turn off to reach Clubhouse Beach which offers the only non-chickee, hike-up primitive camping in this portion of the Everglades. This beach is paradise! White sand beach, clear shallow water, all to yourself! Just be prepared to wade through knee deep marsh to get there and to spend time foraging for wood. \r\n\nSince this is an out-and-back, simply follow the trail back to the trailhead. Ration your water as the last section will be the long prairie section where the sun will beat down on you.

Parts of it are sometimes waterlogged, depending on tides and rainfall, but you can easily detour onto adjacent roads. Many parts of the trail follow the former path of a kiddie-train that used to circle the park.\r\n\nThere are various parking spots throughout the park, but I prefer to park just past the entrance guard booth. Start on the paved road, which runs one-way around the park, until you reach the trailhead on the right. This is a straight section where the old kiddie train used to run. \r\n\nThe trail will intersect with and cross the park road, continuing into forest on the other side. This section winds through the edge of the mangrove forest and is sometimes wet when tides or high or after a lot of rain. In the thick of summer, golden orb weaver spiders stretch their webs across the trail; recommend skipping this section and sticking to the adjacent road at these times unless you want a giant spider on your head. \r\n\nAfter winding through the forest, the trail will emerge onto the park road again. Cross the road onto a short section of boardwalk before passing through a mangrove swamp and coming to the seawall at the Intercoastal Waterway. You can stay on the path along the seawall or jog off to the left, across the road and onto a gravel path that borders the mangroves. The trail turns onto a dirt road that comes in from the left that leads to the group campground. Just down this road, on the left, is the trailhead for a short loop trail that circles a former illegal dump site that used to be located in the middle of the park. \r\n\nIt is now lushly overgrown and is a great addition to the route with some mild elevation gain. After completing the loop, hike back out the way you came on the dirt road to the continuation of the trail on the left. This section of trail cuts directly through the heart of the mangrove swamp and you'll likely get your feet wet at high tide. You'll cross one of the creeks that run through the mangroves and the trail will soon come upon grassy areas with a playground and picnic areas. \r\n\nContinue past the enormous banyan tree with many hanging roots and the entrance to the next section of trail is directly behind the picnic pavilion to the left.

The trail, which is also a vehicle access road for the adjoining property owner, is mostly sunny and in the open. Wetlands border the trail on both sides, and it is raised slightly, making the long views possible. Visitors can hike down and back, which takes about 1 hour or access the other intersecting trails for a longer hike.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7024440/everyone-likes-a-nice-boardwalk", "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 1.4, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [20, 20], "alt-change": [1, 1], "avg-grade": 0.0, "max-grade": 0.0}},

This is habitat for black bears and the endangered Florida Panther, so the refuge specifically recommends not hiking alone. From the parking area, head north through the gate in the fence. Follow the trail as it generally makes a loop around the cell tower. On the west side of the trail, there is a short spur trail to view Otter Pond. Follow signs to stay on the Panther Trail. As you start heading north again, you'll come to a junction with the Leslie M. Duncan Memorial Trail. This trail is a doubletrack suitable for wheelchairs and can be a nice add-on to the Panther Trail.\r\n\nThe Florida Panther is one of the most endangered of all mammals on earth with only 20 panthers existing at one point in the 1970s. With approximately 230 animals currently, this species has bounced back, but is still on the ropes. The Florida Panther is known as an \"umbrella species,\" meaning that if you protect the habitat for the panther, you protect the habitat for hundreds of other animals. This is one of those special places that protects some habitat for Florida Panthers. Historically, they used to be found in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, and South Carolina. Their range and population have been affected primarily by hunting and urbanization causing habitat loss. Today, they are almost exclusively found in Southern Florida, though in 2017, the first evidence since 1973 of a female mating north of the Caloosahatchee River was found, and males (who have much larger roaming areas than females) have been observed into Georgia.  \r\n\nOne of the easiest things YOU can do to protect the Florida Panther and help it be removed from the endangered species list is to drive the speed limit. The area between I-75 and Immokalee has some of the highest vehicle-panther accident rates, which is one of the primary causes of mortality for panthers. There are slower nighttime speed limits in this area, so please observe them. Remember, there are around 200 of them on Earth. Hitting just one with a car removes 0.5% of the entire species.

When in doubt, look for the blazes and they will be there. Though there are multiple trails visible, take a right 100 feet north of the gate right before the small Scrub Jay trail sign. The trail weaves on singletrack and forks at another sign 0.1 miles in (Scrub Jay East/West). \r\n\nTaking a right onto the east part of the loop trail you'll soon cross an open corridor with power lines overhead and continue onto singletrack. After 0.5 miles the trail merges with a sandy roadbed. Take this due north, crossing over an east/west road at 0.75 miles. At 1.1 miles, the trail stops its due north track and turns SW, resuming singletrack travel and traveling with a marshy area on the left. At 1.25 miles, you'll cross over a road, continue along the orange-blazed singletrack. At 1.45 miles, you'll turn right onto the previously mentioned sandy road. \r\n\nIn a few hundred feet the trail veers off to the right back onto singletrack. This is an easy place to miss the trail veering off to the right (even if you missed this, staying on the road will take you all the way back to the trailhead, it'll just be sandy road running).  The singletrack trail continues to weave through scrub forest and open shrubs, crossing roads at 1.6 miles and 1.9 miles and going under the powerlines again at 2.4 miles.

Also back in this part of the park are numerous trail distance signs to gauge your location. At the next intersection, the Yellow Trail big loop joins for a short section. I also want to note that at each major intersection is a kiosk with a map that shows your location and has a covered place to sit and rest. \r\n\nAfter a short distance the Yellow Trail departs to the left (to rejoin us later in the hike). At the next intersection, the Red Trail departs to the right. Here there was a sign indicating that the Red Trail was under water. This was the first indication you would have of this condition and you'd be several miles into your hike at this point. The Blue Trail, however, was unaffected.  \r\n\nAt the next intersection (there's a kiosk here too) we turn left and begin the 2.3-mile trip back.

Beginning hikers will appreciate the trail's moderate elevation change while still providing an exceptional experience. Portions of this trail run along the north fork of Black Creek and allow hikers to fish from the creek's edge as well as see beautiful views.\r\n\nHikeing the second section of the Pioneer Trail (Knights Landing to Ellis Ford) will take visitors on a somewhat more challenging trek than the first half. Continuous elevation change is common along this portion of trail, but with the challenging terrain comes beautiful overlook vistas of Black Creek flowing beneath you. As with the first half, this section of trail offers hikers leveled foot beds and handmade foot crossings, as well as benches scattered throughout the trail for rest.\r\n\nThe third section of the Pioneer Trail (Ellis Ford to the 4-way intersection with Dunn's Farm Trail) is the longest and most demanding with fairly regular changes in elevation, twists, turns, and switchbacks.  Developing this section even included building a bridge\u2014a must see. The section is further punctuated with sideways growing trees to hike under, a stand of cypress trees, a local historic cemetery, a stream with small waterfalls adding sound to your hike, and some high scenic elevation overlooking the North Fork Black Creek.\r\n\nThe fourth section of the trail (4-way intersection with Dunn's Farm Trail to Powell Ford Road) opened in January 2021 and provides the most difficult hiking with 2.8 miles of challenging elevation changes.  Overlooks on this section provide outstanding views of the waterway.  Stairways and some upper or lower path options keep you high or right down by the water making the hike even more interesting. Walkways over water areas add to the character of this section of the trail.\r\n\nHikers will find one camp zone on each segment. These camp zones have ample area for a tent and are equipped with a picnic table and fire ring/grill combo.
