The route to the Marching Bears is very clear, with just a few short spur trails to other spots. The first offshoot leads to the Founders Pond overlook, which is one of the prettiest overlooks in the park. Past that, the trail continues to Nezekaw Point, which other than padding some mileage doesn't offer much. \r\n\nAs you continue towards Marching Bears, the trail (actually an old road) comes to a fork with a small kiosk containing a map. To the left, the trail goes to a mound group that includes a staggeringly long linear mound that is worth the trip, adding about a mile round trip to your hike. If you skip that turn and continue towards the marching bears, you'll come to one more junction, with a left turn taking you to a shaded path to another mound group (comparatively unremarkable but again, padding mileage by roughly .5 miles RT). If you skip that LAST junction, you'll continue on toward the marching bear mound group. It is amazing at all times of year, but if you happen to catch them at the peak \"between mowings,\" the mounds themselves are truly reminiscent of giant, shaggy, supernatural creatures just awaiting an apocalypse. \r\n\nThis trail is fantastic year round, though very difficult with deep snow. In the springtime, it is a particularly excellent spot for ephemeral wildflowers. The large prairie allows this show to continue into the summer, with massive patches of wild blackberries meaning one can really gorge oneself in July and August. \r\n\nThis spot, like all of Effigy Mounds and the Mississippi Bluff country, treats visitors to a staggering array of birds, with the whole area qualifying as an Audubon Important Birding Area which sounds less interesting than it is in the summer, when the cacophony of bird songs demonstrates just how much diversity is present. Other regular encounters include wild turkey, whitetail deer, and of course the ubiquitous bald eagle.\r\n\nA short but harrowing stretch of highway connects this trail with the North Unit, allowing hikers to put together distances up to about 15 miles through prairie, savanna, forest, and one of the region's most spiritual places.

As such, it is worth seeing, but hikers should be prepared to contend with larger crowds than anywhere else in the area. \r\n\nThe trail to the falls, starting from the main parking area, begins as a sidewalk. On the left, before the trail turns to boardwalk, there is a bear effigy mound. This is one of the most accessible\u2014i.e. visible without a steep climb\u2014in the area. As always, respect these features as the sacred spaces they are; do not hike on the mound.\r\n\nAfter the bear, the trail turns to boardwalk with steps. A few \"pullout\" overlooks offer some chances to take in the long views of the Mississippi River without quite as much of a crowd as one finds at the main overlook. \r\n\nContinuing down the steps, the trail turns sharply west (left) and becomes a bit steeper. Trail users cross a few other drainages with similar \"waterfalls,\" but the proper Bridal Veil Falls is obvious. It has its own small boardwalk spur trail to allow close-up views of the waterfall and the cave behind it. Going behind the waterfall is prohibited, but this prohibition is often ignored to the detriment of the highly-erodible hillside on which Bridal Veil Falls sits. Please stay on the boardwalks to prevent destroying the scenery.\r\n\nAt the base of the falls, a large cone is forming. Water flowing out of the hillside deposits minerals in the same spot century after century, creating a \"stalagmite,\" the kind that normally forms in caves, but in this instance is occurring outside. Pretty neat!\r\n\nAfter enjoying the falls, hikers can either turn back the way they came or take the Myotis Trail to get back to the parking area. For a longer day, continue past the falls and visit Hickory Ridge, an incredibly scenic hilltop graced with ancient Native American earthworks. \r\n\nHickory Ridge connects with the far-less-peopled sections of Pike's Peak State Park.", "features": "Cave \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Waterfall", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7046813/pikes-peak-state-park", "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 0.5, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [1119, 1039], "alt-change": [94, 89], "avg-grade": 7.0, "max-grade": 15.0}},

In the fall, experience a kaleidoscope of colors as the leaves change color. Lastly, in the winter, you can experience a sense of solitude. \r\n\nThe oak savanna was once one of the most common vegetation types in the Midwest, but is today highly endangered.

This is what is happening here at Neal Smith. \r\n\nAn oak savanna is a fire-dependent community that typically has spreading, open-grown oak trees with sun-loving grasses, sedges, and wildflowers growing under them. The non-woody plants and oak leaves provide fuel for fire that is often slow and creeping, compared to the fast-moving prairie fires. The shifting light under the trees provides an environment for a unique mixture of understory plants. Species typical of prairie and forest occur together, in addition to species found only in the savanna community.

The establishment of the trail has required dedication from individuals, families, businesses, service organizations, and local, state, and federal grant programs.\r\n\nOn the north end of the trail, you'll travel through the picturesque Loess Hills, which run along the western edge of Iowa. These hills were formed 14,000 years ago by windblown loess (pronounced \"luss\"), a fine and fertile soil, which built up over the years to heights of 200-300 feet. While loess soils are common, the unusual depth and extent of this formation are most prominent here and in northern China.  \r\n\nYou can travel the entire 63 miles by foot, bicycle, wheelchair, ski, or snowshoe. No motorized vehicles are permitted.
