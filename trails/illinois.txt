Next, circle around the two nearby buildings to pick up the IPP on the other side.\r\n\nJust ahead, the trail crosses beneath the highway and immediately connects with the end of the Illinois Prairie Path - Batavia Spur. From here, the scenery continues to change from industrial, to township, and eventually to a nice section of woodland as the trail travels through Warrenville Grove Forest Preserve.\r\n\nA few more miles, with easy-to-follow road crossings, bring the trail to its end in Wheaton, where it intersects with the other two main branches: Illinois Prairie Path - Main Stem and Illinois Prairie Path - Elgin Branch.", "features": "River/Creek \u00b7 Views", "condition": "Unknown"}, "ratings": {"rating": 4.0, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 14.8, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [762, 632], "alt-change": [300, 189], "avg-grade": 1.0, "max-grade": 6.0}},

If you are tired of having to go to Waterfall Glen for a longer (3+ hour) outing, this trail is a great alternative with fewer road crossings. You do occasionally have to keep an eye out for unleashed dogs in the more frequently used parts of the park, but that is only a small portion of the 9+ mile loop.\r\n\nI like to start at the Mountain Bike Staging area/Maple Lake East Trail parking lot. Shortly after the start, the trail empties out onto 95th St.; head right (east) on the road toward the light and go left (north) on Flavin Rd/104th Ave. You'll see the trail pick back up right away on the far side of Flavin Rd. \r\n\nThis next section of the Yellow Trail features a dirt surface and is quiet as it heads north, paralleling Flavin Road. You'll eventually come to an unmarked \"Y\" where you'll want to go right.\r\n\nAfter some more quiet hiking, you'll come to a \"T\" at an intersection with the Tan Trail with no obvious signage for continuing on the Yellow Trail (do not go straight). TURN LEFT. Go to your left just a bit, and you'll see the Yellow Trail marker on the right.

This initial segment is wide but is littered with baby head rocks, making it a bit harder on the feet of pedestrians - this is really the only section of the park where rock plates make much of a difference.\r\n\nAfter about a third of a mile the trail smooths and narrows a bit, and will stay as a comfortably flat singletrack for most of its remainder. There's lots of greenery here and ample shade, making it an easy hike. The occasional forks off the main trail are often designed with features to appeal towards mountain bikers; feel free to branch out to add some variety, but stay off of anything geared towards two wheels.\r\n\nWith the exception of gunshots that can be heard from a range to the east, the Blue Trail feels fairly isolated and quiet, especially as it moves past the ends of the Red Trail and Yellow Trail and into its southern portion. Fewer visitors trek this far south, so you may have the trail to yourself. Try the Blue White Alternate Route here for a change of pace, or stay on course as the main path follows two long ponds. Eventually it crosses over and contours along the Fox River, becoming a bit more humid.\r\n\nAt the southern end, the Blue Trail comes to a confluence with a few short sidetracks, becoming a little confusing. Taking the wrong way is no big deal, as you'll quickly end up back on track. There's a tiny bit more technicality to the trail here as well, with a bit of elevation change, but this is still an easy course.

The views are amazing for almost the entire trail!\r\n\nTrail #049 starts right near where you climb down into the canyon. You can go left or right. I prefer going right (south) making the southern portion of the trail a long descent instead of a climb. Right off the bat, you'll be hiking through some very impressive rock formations and stacked boulders. Explore around right here\u2014it's very cool. Continuing south, you'll see more epic photo ops than you know what to do with. There are bluffs for miles! They just don't stop! And with so many big rocks to hike amongst, you'll find yourself off trail often. But don't worry, Trail #049 is easy to see/find when you do. \r\n\nAs you near the end of the bluffs on the east side, the trail comes to a small horse-camp area and turns right off into the valley you've been hiking beside. This part is not very exciting, but it does cross a couple small creeks. The water in all these creeks is pretty clean, but I'd run a filter just to be sure. Also, keep an eye on the left side for a turn in the trail if not using GPS. The trail looks like a ditch due to washouts.\r\n\nAs you near the bottom of the long descent, you'll come to a trail intersection. Trail #049 goes left and 049D straight ahead. 049D follows the creek a little ways, crosses, then ties into 049E. 049E then goes pretty much straight to the main falls area should you want to skip the west side bluffs. Heading to the west side? Hang a left and cross the creek. Normally, it's easy to cross via rock stepping stones without getting wet. Actually, two creeks converge here. After crossing the first one, the trail goes right alongside the second creek and continues west for 0.25 miles then loops you under even taller bluffs. \r\n\nContinue on at the base of the bluffs, now heading east, and you'll be treated to another onslaught of magnificent views. You'll likely encounter a few, or possibly many, rock climbers along this stretch depending on the weather/time of year. It is the Mecca for rock climbing in Southern Illinois and is one of only two places that it's publicly allowed.\r\n\nAfter about a mile down the bluff line, you'll be at the base of the main falls at Jackson Falls. This is a really cool area! Check downstream here too for neat little nook and cranny falls and pools. \r\n\nAfter crossing the creek at the falls, there are many user-created trails along the base of the final epic bluffs. Trail #049 is not marked well through here, but if you stay close to the bluffs, you'll hike right to the East Falls and the point where you climbed down into the canyon to begin this trail.", "features": "Cave \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Spring \u00b7 Swimming \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Waterfall \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7067897/its-good-to-see-things-like-this-when-you-make-friends-with-copperheads", "ratings": {"rating": 4.5, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 3.3, "dist-type": "Loop", "alt-range": [648, 487], "alt-change": [259, 271], "avg-grade": 3.0, "max-grade": 16.0}},

Though it is open to foot traffic as well, hikers are seldom seen on this trail which is one of its highlights. Uncrowded, quiet, and private, it is a thoroughly enjoyable trek through typical Midwest prairie and woodlands. The terrain is mostly flat with gentle rises, however hikers should be aware that being primarily a horse trail, it lacks bridges over Rush Creek which it crosses near the start and finish. In the spring and after heavy rains, this means either waterproof high top boots will be needed, or removing footwear and wading across will be required. At their highest the crossings average about ten inches deep and 15-20 feet wide, and in the dryer summer months four inches x 5-6 feet across. The pay-off is you'll have the nearly six miles essentially to yourself.\r\n\nEven with lack of bridges and having to be conscious of the occasional \"gifts\" left by horses, this is a great trail to take a dog on. Just please always keep watch for riders and keep your pets under tight control around them out of courtesy and to prevent spooking the horses.\r\n\nThis trail won't appeal to casual hikers out for a quick loop with the kids, but is ideal for those looking for a little solitude and some decent mileage. \r\n\nThere are no facilities or benches, or treated water on this course.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7044676/about-a-mile-to-the-horse-trailer-lot", "ratings": {"rating": 4.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 5.9, "dist-type": "Loop", "alt-range": [1017, 923], "alt-change": [194, 193], "avg-grade": 1.0, "max-grade": 5.0}},

The dips and rises here were formed by the advance and retreat of immense ice chunks during the last Ice Age. When the weather warmed, grasslands dominated. In autumn, big bluestem and switchgrass turn amber brown and yellow, swaying to the music of the wind.\r\n\nMcDonald Woods is a perfect place to hike, bike and cross-country ski. Trails here connect to the Millennium Trail and other community hiking and biking paths. The 3.8-mile loop gravel trail winds around the woods and wetlands. A 0.3-mile woodchip trail is open for hiking and cross-country skiing and leads to a basswood and sugar maple forest, glowing yellow in autumn.\r\n\nPlease keep dogs leashed and on trails at all times, and pick up after them.\r\n\nAcquired in the 1970s, the preserve was named after its owner A. B. McDonald. He created a private nature preserve on roughly 295 acres in the 1940s, building three lakes and planting a pine grove and other trees.

He owned a grocery and dry goods store in Waukegan and served as an alderman and township supervisor. \r\n\nPhilip Blanchard was another notable owner of this land. Born in New York in 1804, he moved to the area when he was 33 years old and eventually became a Warren Township judge. During the Civil War, Blanchard is known to have assisted slaves in gaining their freedom through the underground railroad. It is quite possible that runaway slaves stayed at this Lyons Woods property on their way to Canada. In 1868, Blanchard donated his land for a schoolhouse, which stood at the corner of Sheridan and Blanchard Roads and operated until 1940. The building was later used as a tavern.\r\n\nOther early landowners include Alson Smith Sherman, who was mayor of Chicago in 1844, and Asiel Blodgett, who was a captain in the Civil War and later mayor of Waukegan. Around 1940, George Pavlik acquired land at the preserve's southeast corner and established the nursery that gave rise to the evergreen grove now seen near the parking lot. Pavlik had an unusual passion for pine trees. Pines eventually became popular and his were sought after for projects at places ranging from estates in Lake Forest to the Air Force Academy in Colorado.\r\n\nThis land was acquired as a forest preserve in parcels between 1976 and 1986. Trails and parking opened here in 1996. They were made possible by voter support of a Forest Preserve referendum.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "ratings": {"rating": 5.0, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 2.0, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [731, 650], "alt-change": [10, 90], "avg-grade": 1.0, "max-grade": 2.0}},

The trail gives unparalleled access to the Des Plaines River. It can be accessed by several forest preserves and parks that are very close to towns in the area. It is important to be aware that the trail is mixed use; cyclists and pedestrians frequent this trail so it is important to be attentive to fellow trail users. In the winter, this trail can be used for snowshoeing and cross country skiing.\r\n\nDue to its proximity to the Des Plaines River, the trail is relatively level with a few short low grade hills. It runs through woodlands, oak savannah, plains, and wetland areas. Mosquitoes and ticks can be found during the warmer months, so be sure to check for them after your hike.\r\n\nThe trail is primarily gravel with a few sections of concrete or asphalt when different parts of the trail are connected via roads, bridges, or underpasses. After periods of heavy rain, these underpasses may be impassable; there may be detours available.\r\n\nOne of the largest forest preserves that the Des Plaines River Trail runs through is Independence Grove, which is a reclaimed gravel quarry which provides a number of activities from fishing to concerts.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 Lake \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7064401/scene-from-the-trail", "ratings": {"rating": 4.0, "num_reviewers": 5}, "stats": {"dist": 32.5, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [720, 637], "alt-change": [421, 369], "avg-grade": 0.0, "max-grade": 4.0}},

The trails are multi-use and are open year round to walkers, hikers, runners and bikers. This trail is not open to horses.\r\n\nThe I.C. Rail Trail can be accessed from four different locations, \r\n1. Via the Lowell Parkway Trail (bike path) starting at the parking lot on Washington St. \r\n2. Via the gravel road leading from the dog park at the end of Washington St. out to the Meadows Park trails. There is a parking lot at the dog park.\r\n3. Lowell Park via the connector trail to the Lowell Parkway Trail (bike path). Parking is at the Nature center.\r\n4. At the intersection of Lowell Park Road and the Joe Stengel Trail/Lowell Park Trail.
