Descend the steps down the fairly steep grade and you'll be greeted with the most narrow passage, \"Fat Woman's Squeeze\". Don't worry, you'll make it through just fine! Just after this section, you can head off on the yellow trail (Bottom of Gorge), but stay on the red trail (Top of Gorge Rim Trail) to continue this loop. Connections to the yellow trail are at waypoints C & D on the posted signage. As you continue taking in the scenery, you'll climb up and down some fairly steep areas with breathtaking views of the rock geology. Once you reach waypoint G on the red trail, head to your left. If you head up, you'll miss half of the trail and you don't want to do that! \r\n\nFrom here, its a steep climb up the stairs, but the trail will level out as you reach waypoints F and H. As you continue along the trail, you'll have some great views of the trail below that you just hiked on. Watch the kids and pets here as a fall would be catastrophic. Just before waypoint I, you'll reach a small rest shelter. Continue on the hike across a small bridge where you'll likely see some people below that you can yell down and wave at.

The payoff to the trail\u2014good for more advanced hikers and those testing out new shoes, packs, and gear\u2014is the amazing cliff ledge overlook and massive rock staircase. Or you can access the overlook from the parking lot for an easier reward.  Steep in spots, this is a trail that makes you think you\u2019re not in Ohio anymore;  perhaps somewhere else in the world entirely, surely not the Cleveland-Akron area. \r\n\nWhat Makes It Great: \n\nThe Ledges Loop Trail is a moderate excursion through sandstone cliffs, known as Ritchie Ledges, and there are plenty of places on this trail where confident footing will come in handy. There are some very cool petroglyphs that date back to the 1900s along the way, though it's not known who carved them. \r\n\nWhether or not you plan on exploring the deep caves during your visit, you can count on one of the best views of autumn from the cliffs and the best CVNP sunset, period.  If timed right, this is one of the best views of the Cuyahoga Valley. If you want to add some time to your trip, check the sidebar for nearby trails.\r\n\nWho is Going to Love It: \n\nTop to bottom, this whole suite within the CVNP is a stunner. So much so that some heartier visitors will feel compelled to forego Brandywine Falls for this trail\u2014and would be well within rights to do so. Kids and geology enthusiasts are especially drawn to the Sharon Conglomerate of alcoves, crevices, formations, and outcroppings that are estimated to be millions of years old. But when it comes to making this trek, parents may have trouble keeping up with those nimble kiddos along the rockier parts, and those with knee and hip problems might wish for a trail with lesser stress or strain.", "features": "Fall Colors \u00b7 Views", "condition": "All Clear"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7015930/ledges-trail-at-its-most-lush-photo-by-sue-simenc", "ratings": {"rating": 4.5, "num_reviewers": 48}, "stats": {"dist": 1.7, "dist-type": "Loop", "alt-range": [1045, 944], "alt-change": [120, 121], "avg-grade": 3.0, "max-grade": 8.0}},

Please note: there is currently no bridge across Brandywine Creek. We encourage you to head back out the same way that you came, and enjoy a new look at the same route. However, if you attempt to cross the stream, do so at your own risk and be careful, since the rocks are slippery and the current can be strong.\r\n\nWhat Makes It Great: \n\nChock full of sandstone and shale, peppered with hemlock, white oak, black locust, maple trees, and bearing a color palette that is ever-changing, these Falls make a great starting point or finish line to any major trek through the surrounding CVNP trails. Whether you choose the Brandywine Gorge Trail, or the Stanford Trail (or both), or simply chose a more in-and-out sightseeing stop, there is plenty to take in here.

It covers just under 2.5 miles and besides a steep start, is a nice rolling, moderate outing.\r\n\nThe trailhead for Furnace Run begins across the street from the Everett Bridge parking area. Furnace Run Trail is not to be confused with Furnace Run Metro Park. Starting off, you'll be met with more than 90 zigzagging stairs that will raise your pulse and provide a good warm up for rest of your journey. At the top of the stairs you'll once again be on terra firma, where a nearly straight, smooth .7-mile path will lead you through the forest past dozens of downed trees and vines, across Oak Hill Road to the trailhead of Furnace Loop, a serene half-mile jaunt along moss-mottled ground.\r\n\nWhat Makes It Great: \n\nThe Furnace Run Trail is impediment-free and spacious, so it provides an ideal place to take children on their first hike as long as everyone can make it up the 90 manmade stairs. And, it's fun to look for the downed tree on the Furnace Run Trail that acts as a squirrel pedestrian bridge, and the shark-bitten tree and interesting green puffs of grass along Furnace Run. Remember to bring your bug spray: The deer flies are determined to taste your repellent-sprayed skin despite flailing arms and verbal threats.\r\n\nThe rolling hills of the trail are fun to navigate especially with the whistling of black-capped chickadees drowning out the sounds from the nearby road. Other small woodland creatures may decide to make an appearance, so don't get too long in the birdsong to miss out on the squirrels, chipmunks, and rabbits around you.\r\n\nBecause the parking area for Furnace Run Trail is shared by both Perkins and Riding Run, visitors who finish the Furnace Run loop and are looking for more can easily move on to these two loops.\r\n\nWho Will Love It: \n\nCity residents will appreciate the quiet and solitude just a short half-hour drive from downtown. A quick trip here will make you feel miles away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Rocky Balboa wannabes and those preparing for Cleveland's annual Tackle the Tower competition will love the climb.", "features": "Views", "condition": "All Clear"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7043355/highlights-of-a-hike-on-the-furnace-run-trail-in-the-early-fall", "ratings": {"rating": 4.5, "num_reviewers": 13}, "stats": {"dist": 2.0, "dist-type": "Loop", "alt-range": [987, 747], "alt-change": [267, 268], "avg-grade": 5.0, "max-grade": 26.0}},

This 2.75-miler is one of four trails in the park to have earned CVNP\u2019s most difficult rating, and for good reason: it\u2019s tough. This trail makes for a fun and challenging hike, run, or ride: it\u2019s open to horses, but people on foot are welcome too. The Perkins Trail starts at Everett Covered Bridge, and while the beginning of the trail may seem a bit mellow, you won\u2019t have to wait long for the challenging part to kick in. And, if some benevolent individual leaves a pair of walking sticks next to Perkins Trail\u2019s initial post, take a hint and grab them. You\u2019ll need them to steady yourself and to judge the depth of the upcoming mud pits.\r\n\nWhat Makes It Great: \n\nAs mentioned above, the trail starts out pretty mellow, but just as you begin to question why the rating is so difficult, it leads you on a grown-up game of Chutes and Ladders up switchbacks, around muddy sections, down steep, pebbly slopes, and across a shallow, stone-filled creek all while trying to identify wild berries, yielding the right of way to toads and miniature frogs, and marveling at Mother Nature\u2019s art. It\u2019s a workout.\r\n\nOne of the coolest things you'll see along the trail is the result of a 1996 thunderstorm that damaged a slew of trees. So, in addition to a forest full of tall, healthy oaks, beeches, hawthorns, and hickories, that are wonderful for shielding you 100 percent from the summer sun, you\u2019ll encounter a stump peeled like a banana, a couple of moss-covered logs resembling rolls of Astroturf, and a perfectly parallel trio of toppled trees that look like the makings of a lean-to.\r\n\nAnother great part about this trail is that if you find this shorter trail isn\u2019t long enough, you can connect to the Riding Run Trail and add on another four miles of moderate to difficult hiking.\r\n\nWho Will Love It: \n\nAvid hikers in search of a new challenge will appreciate the cardio workout that Perkins Trail provides. Less experienced visitors will revel in the sense of accomplishment they feel once they\u2019ve completed their trek. The solitude and silence will appeal to creative types and deep thinkers in need of a serene source of inspiration, a place to meditate, or a detox from daily stressors.

While Pine Grove is moderately strenuous, it\u2019s not steep or so perilous as to separate friends and family based on skill set.

The scenery along the way is beautiful, passing over the Cuyahoga River and through the woods past a few privately-owned farms, and finally to a hill that overlooks the valley. The second section, Wetmore Trailhead to Boston Trailhead, will delight nature lovers with oaks, hickories, and maple trees as well as violets, daffodils, and other flowers. If you\u2019re still going, the remainder of the trail alternates between field and forest for your viewing pleasure.\r\n\nThis trail can be made as long or as short as you want and it\u2019s speckled with interesting views and attractions along the way. You\u2019ll pass a tree nursery that operated during the Great Depression and provided 3.5 million seedlings that repopulated the valley, the Hunt Farm Information Center, and Szalay\u2019s Farm market at .9 miles where you can stop and take a break, but not a long one. You have a lot of ground to cover, and this is not a loop.\r\n\nWho Will Love It: \n\nThe Valley Trail enables equestrians to see a wide swath of land without tiring. They can even start at one end and have someone pick them up at another trailhead with a horse trailer.\r\n\nThough not as precarious as the Perkins Trail, Valley presents a few challenges that serious hikers will enjoy.", "features": "Fall Colors \u00b7 Views", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7015933/this-section-of-the-bt-is-one-of-the-most-unique-and-stunning-in-cvnp-be-careful", "ratings": {"rating": 4.5, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 11.9, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [1020, 694], "alt-change": [920, 1106], "avg-grade": 3.0, "max-grade": 23.0}},

A 2013 Trail Management Plan was executed and pulled the section back in line with the trail corridor, which is anchored by the moderate Wetmore and Langes Trail loops. The whole Wetmore area is comprised of about 9 miles in all, but is part of 20 miles of equestrian trails that fortify this region of the CVNP\u2014made up of old farmers paths and logging roads.\r\n\nWhat Makes It Great: \n\nVersatility.

Be sure to yield to bridle-equestrian traffic: they have the right of way!

According to the Buckeye Trail Association, a nonprofit group that manages and maintains the trail \"a visitor can experience a little of all that Ohio has to offer.\" The Cuyahoga Valley National Park (CVNP) is home to 37 of these miles, which the Park's Trails Council has divided into several segments of varying difficulty ranging in length from 1.5 miles - 7 miles.\r\n\nThe smaller section from Pine Lane to Boston Store is a moderately challenging four-mile out and back route (or you can shuttle a car to the visitor center before you start and drive back to Pine Lane instead of traveling on foot). \r\n\nYou can complete this portion of the trail in either direction, but the trailhead is easier to find when starting at Pine Lane.  The trail itself is a narrow singletrack mixed with abandoned roads and wider lanes. It can be very rocky and rooty at times, so watch your step! While this trail is not a loop, (this section ends out of the park, near the Riverwoods Golf Course) you can hop onto the Towpath as you cool down back to your car.\r\n\nWhat Makes It Great: \n\nThe ever-changing landscapes along the trail make it wonderful. There are forests of pine (including a stand of rare white pines near the middle of the trail), oak and hemlock; orchards; ravines, and special spots where you are surrounded by a variety of plants, wildflowers, and birds. There is even some highway viewing mixed in, and while that may sound like a deterrent to your peaceful day out in nature, don't be too quick to judge. There are some amazing views along the road that provide great photo opportunities.\r\n\nBecause the trail offers so much variety in it setting\u2014 it's ups and downs (some more challenging than others), creek crossings, pedestrian bridges, and other natural obstacles to maneuver around\u2014be sure to keep your eyes out for the blue blazes that mark the Buckeye Trail. The trail is well-maintained and well-signed, so finding your way should not be a problem.\r\n\n\nWho Will Love It: \n\nThose looking for a trail with a wide variety of terrain to explore will find this trail enthralling. Those looking for a bit of a longer trek will be happy to find it very easy to add some distance onto their journey with the nearby Towpath, the rest of the Buckeye Trail itself, or one of the Buckeye's shorter off-shoots.

It's nice if you're looking to get some miles in running or hiking, but does not have a lot in the way of scenic attractions. Despite the name, only a couple small parts have views along the shore of the lake. Most of the views are of trees, the disc golf course, access roads, parking lots, maintenance buildings, and a bunch of backyards of private residences.\r\n\nEnter the park through the main gate on Manchester Road, and follow the park road all the way to the end to the large parking lot at Turkeyfoot Beach. The trail starts on a gravel path that runs behind the playground set; go right to take the trail clockwise, or left to go counter-clockwise.\r\n\nIf you go clockwise, the gravel path takes you down past the sand volleyball court. Continue across the middle of the sand, and look for an un-marked entrance to the trail towards the left-hand shore of the lake. This will take you out to the end of a short peninsula, then continue back on the other side of the peninsula. If you're only looking for lake views, just do this and skip the rest.\r\n\nIf you go counter-clockwise, then shortly after you get past the playground, turn right down a gentle slope towards the end of the beach. You'll see a miniature lighthouse near the shore; turn left there and follow the trail signs.\r\n\nThis trail exemplifies what frustrates me about many trail systems. The signs are intended to help people who don't know the way, but the signs are put up by people who already know the way, so sometimes they can be quite confounding. The online map says the Shoreline Trail is a 5-mile loop. The maps on-site say the trail is 3.5-mile loop, but there is also a Shoreline Extension Trail, so you have to look for that to do the whole five miles. \r\n\nHowever, the on-trail markers don't make any distinction between the main trail and the extension. There are maps at major intersections, which are often helpful, but some intersections with no map or signs at all. One map shows a three-way, but it's actually a four-way, so I was left to decipher which of the four was the one not represented. I assumed it was the one with the gas pipeline signs, but no, that's wrong; you DO want to follow the gas pipeline signs to continue on the Shoreline Trail. Another sign seems to tell you to hop over a fence into the dog park area; you really just need to hike around the fence and pick up the trail on the other side.\r\n\nTo help navigate this route and prevent wrong turns, use the Hiking Project mobile app.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 Lake \u00b7 Spring \u00b7 Swimming \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7027066/this-is-a-confusing-sign-near-the-dog-park-on-the-shoreline-trail-turn-left-and-", "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 5.5, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [1065, 991], "alt-change": [150, 134], "avg-grade": 1.0, "max-grade": 6.0}},
