Descend the steps down the fairly steep grade and you'll be greeted with the most narrow passage, \"Fat Woman's Squeeze\". Don't worry, you'll make it through just fine! Just after this section, you can head off on the yellow trail (Bottom of Gorge), but stay on the red trail (Top of Gorge Rim Trail) to continue this loop. Connections to the yellow trail are at waypoints C & D on the posted signage. As you continue taking in the scenery, you'll climb up and down some fairly steep areas with breathtaking views of the rock geology. Once you reach waypoint G on the red trail, head to your left. If you head up, you'll miss half of the trail and you don't want to do that! \r\n\nFrom here, its a steep climb up the stairs, but the trail will level out as you reach waypoints F and H. As you continue along the trail, you'll have some great views of the trail below that you just hiked on. Watch the kids and pets here as a fall would be catastrophic. Just before waypoint I, you'll reach a small rest shelter. Continue on the hike across a small bridge where you'll likely see some people below that you can yell down and wave at.

The payoff to the trail\u2014good for more advanced hikers and those testing out new shoes, packs, and gear\u2014is the amazing cliff ledge overlook and massive rock staircase. Or you can access the overlook from the parking lot for an easier reward.  Steep in spots, this is a trail that makes you think you\u2019re not in Ohio anymore;  perhaps somewhere else in the world entirely, surely not the Cleveland-Akron area. \r\n\nWhat Makes It Great: \n\nThe Ledges Loop Trail is a moderate excursion through sandstone cliffs, known as Ritchie Ledges, and there are plenty of places on this trail where confident footing will come in handy. There are some very cool petroglyphs that date back to the 1900s along the way, though it's not known who carved them. \r\n\nWhether or not you plan on exploring the deep caves during your visit, you can count on one of the best views of autumn from the cliffs and the best CVNP sunset, period.  If timed right, this is one of the best views of the Cuyahoga Valley. If you want to add some time to your trip, check the sidebar for nearby trails.\r\n\nWho is Going to Love It: \n\nTop to bottom, this whole suite within the CVNP is a stunner. So much so that some heartier visitors will feel compelled to forego Brandywine Falls for this trail\u2014and would be well within rights to do so. Kids and geology enthusiasts are especially drawn to the Sharon Conglomerate of alcoves, crevices, formations, and outcroppings that are estimated to be millions of years old. But when it comes to making this trek, parents may have trouble keeping up with those nimble kiddos along the rockier parts, and those with knee and hip problems might wish for a trail with lesser stress or strain.", "features": "Fall Colors \u00b7 Views", "condition": "All Clear"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7015930/ledges-trail-at-its-most-lush-photo-by-sue-simenc", "ratings": {"rating": 4.5, "num_reviewers": 48}, "stats": {"dist": 1.7, "dist-type": "Loop", "alt-range": [1045, 944], "alt-change": [120, 121], "avg-grade": 3.0, "max-grade": 8.0}},

Please note: there is currently no bridge across Brandywine Creek. We encourage you to head back out the same way that you came, and enjoy a new look at the same route. However, if you attempt to cross the stream, do so at your own risk and be careful, since the rocks are slippery and the current can be strong.\r\n\nWhat Makes It Great: \n\nChock full of sandstone and shale, peppered with hemlock, white oak, black locust, maple trees, and bearing a color palette that is ever-changing, these Falls make a great starting point or finish line to any major trek through the surrounding CVNP trails. Whether you choose the Brandywine Gorge Trail, or the Stanford Trail (or both), or simply chose a more in-and-out sightseeing stop, there is plenty to take in here.

It covers just under 2.5 miles and besides a steep start, is a nice rolling, moderate outing.\r\n\nThe trailhead for Furnace Run begins across the street from the Everett Bridge parking area. Furnace Run Trail is not to be confused with Furnace Run Metro Park. Starting off, you'll be met with more than 90 zigzagging stairs that will raise your pulse and provide a good warm up for rest of your journey. At the top of the stairs you'll once again be on terra firma, where a nearly straight, smooth .7-mile path will lead you through the forest past dozens of downed trees and vines, across Oak Hill Road to the trailhead of Furnace Loop, a serene half-mile jaunt along moss-mottled ground.\r\n\nWhat Makes It Great: \n\nThe Furnace Run Trail is impediment-free and spacious, so it provides an ideal place to take children on their first hike as long as everyone can make it up the 90 manmade stairs. And, it's fun to look for the downed tree on the Furnace Run Trail that acts as a squirrel pedestrian bridge, and the shark-bitten tree and interesting green puffs of grass along Furnace Run. Remember to bring your bug spray: The deer flies are determined to taste your repellent-sprayed skin despite flailing arms and verbal threats.\r\n\nThe rolling hills of the trail are fun to navigate especially with the whistling of black-capped chickadees drowning out the sounds from the nearby road. Other small woodland creatures may decide to make an appearance, so don't get too long in the birdsong to miss out on the squirrels, chipmunks, and rabbits around you.\r\n\nBecause the parking area for Furnace Run Trail is shared by both Perkins and Riding Run, visitors who finish the Furnace Run loop and are looking for more can easily move on to these two loops.\r\n\nWho Will Love It: \n\nCity residents will appreciate the quiet and solitude just a short half-hour drive from downtown. A quick trip here will make you feel miles away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Rocky Balboa wannabes and those preparing for Cleveland's annual Tackle the Tower competition will love the climb.", "features": "Views", "condition": "All Clear"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7043355/highlights-of-a-hike-on-the-furnace-run-trail-in-the-early-fall", "ratings": {"rating": 4.5, "num_reviewers": 13}, "stats": {"dist": 2.0, "dist-type": "Loop", "alt-range": [987, 747], "alt-change": [267, 268], "avg-grade": 5.0, "max-grade": 26.0}},

This 2.75-miler is one of four trails in the park to have earned CVNP\u2019s most difficult rating, and for good reason: it\u2019s tough. This trail makes for a fun and challenging hike, run, or ride: it\u2019s open to horses, but people on foot are welcome too. The Perkins Trail starts at Everett Covered Bridge, and while the beginning of the trail may seem a bit mellow, you won\u2019t have to wait long for the challenging part to kick in. And, if some benevolent individual leaves a pair of walking sticks next to Perkins Trail\u2019s initial post, take a hint and grab them. You\u2019ll need them to steady yourself and to judge the depth of the upcoming mud pits.\r\n\nWhat Makes It Great: \n\nAs mentioned above, the trail starts out pretty mellow, but just as you begin to question why the rating is so difficult, it leads you on a grown-up game of Chutes and Ladders up switchbacks, around muddy sections, down steep, pebbly slopes, and across a shallow, stone-filled creek all while trying to identify wild berries, yielding the right of way to toads and miniature frogs, and marveling at Mother Nature\u2019s art. It\u2019s a workout.\r\n\nOne of the coolest things you'll see along the trail is the result of a 1996 thunderstorm that damaged a slew of trees. So, in addition to a forest full of tall, healthy oaks, beeches, hawthorns, and hickories, that are wonderful for shielding you 100 percent from the summer sun, you\u2019ll encounter a stump peeled like a banana, a couple of moss-covered logs resembling rolls of Astroturf, and a perfectly parallel trio of toppled trees that look like the makings of a lean-to.\r\n\nAnother great part about this trail is that if you find this shorter trail isn\u2019t long enough, you can connect to the Riding Run Trail and add on another four miles of moderate to difficult hiking.\r\n\nWho Will Love It: \n\nAvid hikers in search of a new challenge will appreciate the cardio workout that Perkins Trail provides. Less experienced visitors will revel in the sense of accomplishment they feel once they\u2019ve completed their trek. The solitude and silence will appeal to creative types and deep thinkers in need of a serene source of inspiration, a place to meditate, or a detox from daily stressors.

While Pine Grove is moderately strenuous, it\u2019s not steep or so perilous as to separate friends and family based on skill set.

The scenery along the way is beautiful, passing over the Cuyahoga River and through the woods past a few privately-owned farms, and finally to a hill that overlooks the valley. The second section, Wetmore Trailhead to Boston Trailhead, will delight nature lovers with oaks, hickories, and maple trees as well as violets, daffodils, and other flowers. If you\u2019re still going, the remainder of the trail alternates between field and forest for your viewing pleasure.\r\n\nThis trail can be made as long or as short as you want and it\u2019s speckled with interesting views and attractions along the way. You\u2019ll pass a tree nursery that operated during the Great Depression and provided 3.5 million seedlings that repopulated the valley, the Hunt Farm Information Center, and Szalay\u2019s Farm market at .9 miles where you can stop and take a break, but not a long one. You have a lot of ground to cover, and this is not a loop.\r\n\nWho Will Love It: \n\nThe Valley Trail enables equestrians to see a wide swath of land without tiring. They can even start at one end and have someone pick them up at another trailhead with a horse trailer.\r\n\nThough not as precarious as the Perkins Trail, Valley presents a few challenges that serious hikers will enjoy.", "features": "Fall Colors \u00b7 Views", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7015933/this-section-of-the-bt-is-one-of-the-most-unique-and-stunning-in-cvnp-be-careful", "ratings": {"rating": 4.5, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 11.9, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [1020, 694], "alt-change": [920, 1106], "avg-grade": 3.0, "max-grade": 23.0}},

A 2013 Trail Management Plan was executed and pulled the section back in line with the trail corridor, which is anchored by the moderate Wetmore and Langes Trail loops. The whole Wetmore area is comprised of about 9 miles in all, but is part of 20 miles of equestrian trails that fortify this region of the CVNP\u2014made up of old farmers paths and logging roads.\r\n\nWhat Makes It Great: \n\nVersatility.

Be sure to yield to bridle-equestrian traffic: they have the right of way!

According to the Buckeye Trail Association, a nonprofit group that manages and maintains the trail \"a visitor can experience a little of all that Ohio has to offer.\" The Cuyahoga Valley National Park (CVNP) is home to 37 of these miles, which the Park's Trails Council has divided into several segments of varying difficulty ranging in length from 1.5 miles - 7 miles.\r\n\nThe smaller section from Pine Lane to Boston Store is a moderately challenging four-mile out and back route (or you can shuttle a car to the visitor center before you start and drive back to Pine Lane instead of traveling on foot). \r\n\nYou can complete this portion of the trail in either direction, but the trailhead is easier to find when starting at Pine Lane.  The trail itself is a narrow singletrack mixed with abandoned roads and wider lanes. It can be very rocky and rooty at times, so watch your step! While this trail is not a loop, (this section ends out of the park, near the Riverwoods Golf Course) you can hop onto the Towpath as you cool down back to your car.\r\n\nWhat Makes It Great: \n\nThe ever-changing landscapes along the trail make it wonderful. There are forests of pine (including a stand of rare white pines near the middle of the trail), oak and hemlock; orchards; ravines, and special spots where you are surrounded by a variety of plants, wildflowers, and birds. There is even some highway viewing mixed in, and while that may sound like a deterrent to your peaceful day out in nature, don't be too quick to judge. There are some amazing views along the road that provide great photo opportunities.\r\n\nBecause the trail offers so much variety in it setting\u2014 it's ups and downs (some more challenging than others), creek crossings, pedestrian bridges, and other natural obstacles to maneuver around\u2014be sure to keep your eyes out for the blue blazes that mark the Buckeye Trail. The trail is well-maintained and well-signed, so finding your way should not be a problem.\r\n\n\nWho Will Love It: \n\nThose looking for a trail with a wide variety of terrain to explore will find this trail enthralling. Those looking for a bit of a longer trek will be happy to find it very easy to add some distance onto their journey with the nearby Towpath, the rest of the Buckeye Trail itself, or one of the Buckeye's shorter off-shoots.

It's nice if you're looking to get some miles in running or hiking, but does not have a lot in the way of scenic attractions. Despite the name, only a couple small parts have views along the shore of the lake. Most of the views are of trees, the disc golf course, access roads, parking lots, maintenance buildings, and a bunch of backyards of private residences.\r\n\nEnter the park through the main gate on Manchester Road, and follow the park road all the way to the end to the large parking lot at Turkeyfoot Beach. The trail starts on a gravel path that runs behind the playground set; go right to take the trail clockwise, or left to go counter-clockwise.\r\n\nIf you go clockwise, the gravel path takes you down past the sand volleyball court. Continue across the middle of the sand, and look for an un-marked entrance to the trail towards the left-hand shore of the lake. This will take you out to the end of a short peninsula, then continue back on the other side of the peninsula. If you're only looking for lake views, just do this and skip the rest.\r\n\nIf you go counter-clockwise, then shortly after you get past the playground, turn right down a gentle slope towards the end of the beach. You'll see a miniature lighthouse near the shore; turn left there and follow the trail signs.\r\n\nThis trail exemplifies what frustrates me about many trail systems. The signs are intended to help people who don't know the way, but the signs are put up by people who already know the way, so sometimes they can be quite confounding. The online map says the Shoreline Trail is a 5-mile loop. The maps on-site say the trail is 3.5-mile loop, but there is also a Shoreline Extension Trail, so you have to look for that to do the whole five miles. \r\n\nHowever, the on-trail markers don't make any distinction between the main trail and the extension. There are maps at major intersections, which are often helpful, but some intersections with no map or signs at all. One map shows a three-way, but it's actually a four-way, so I was left to decipher which of the four was the one not represented. I assumed it was the one with the gas pipeline signs, but no, that's wrong; you DO want to follow the gas pipeline signs to continue on the Shoreline Trail. Another sign seems to tell you to hop over a fence into the dog park area; you really just need to hike around the fence and pick up the trail on the other side.\r\n\nTo help navigate this route and prevent wrong turns, use the Hiking Project mobile app.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 Lake \u00b7 Spring \u00b7 Swimming \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7027066/this-is-a-confusing-sign-near-the-dog-park-on-the-shoreline-trail-turn-left-and-", "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 5.5, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [1065, 991], "alt-change": [150, 134], "avg-grade": 1.0, "max-grade": 6.0}},

It now runs between the Fort Ancient river access off Rt. 350 (next to Morgan's Canoe Livery) and Morgan's Riverside Campground. This trail is blazed in white. Keep an eye out for the blazes, because this is not a well-traveled trail and becomes obscured.\r\n\nFrom the river access parking lot, turn south onto Rt. 350 and cross the bridge over the Little Miami River. Stay as close to the railing as you can, since the curve of the bridge makes it difficult for drivers to see you. At the bottom of the bridge, hang a left through the gate and follow along the perimeter of either side of the open field. This section is an easy hike, although sometimes it becomes flooded. As you are cruising along, look for the reconstructed stone serpent Kern Effigies (one on each side of the field.)\r\n\nAt the far end of the field, you'll enter the woods and follow along the riverbank. Portions of this trail are littered with debris from river flooding, so watch your step. Soon after crossing a rocky creek bed, you'll make a steep climb up a hill with railroad-tie steps. You'll not climb to the top of the hill, so watch for the turnoff to your left.\r\n\nAfter the climb, you'll be on a fairly flat stretch of trail which is often wet and muddy, made worse by mole activity. Several large trees have fallen across the trail, so you'll need to either climb over or around them. You'll continue along this section for about a half mile when the trail begins to widen, rise, and curve to the right. At this point, watch closely for the white blaze to your left. You'll make a quick left and head down the slope to the valley floor. At the bottom, follow the blazes to a rocky roadbed. Climb the roadbed to the top of the hill and go left at the blaze.\r\n\nKeep a close eye on the blazes through this section, since the trail becomes obscured. You'll drop in and out of several gullies before finally making your way back downhill over another old roadbed. Once you reach the bottom, you'll cross a creek and find yourself in the Morgan\u2019s campground. I usually make this an out-and-back, turning around at this creek.

You can download a trail map here. The 1300 acre area is managed by the Ohio Historical Society and the Appalachian Arc.\r\n\nFort Trail encircles and even enters a large ancient earthwork built by the Hopewell Culture some 2,000 years ago.  These Native Americans were instrumental in constructing dozens of hilltop enclosures and countless mounds in southern Ohio. We do not know what these ancient peoples called themselves, what language they spoke, or what ultimately happened to them, but we do know that they left some pretty amazing and mysterious earthen structures.  \r\n\nInformation gleaned from the Arc of Appalachia website shows that Fort Hill was likely not a fort at all but a place where the Hopewell culture gathered for ceremonies. As you hike the Fort Trail, you'll see that the earthen wall follows the natural contour of the rim of the plateau. For specific numbers on wall height, length, and other interesting facts about Fort Hill please visit the Arc of Appalachia website.  \r\n\nYou'll begin your hike at the parking area at the base of the hill. As you drive into the park, you'll pass a small museum that is only open on Saturdays from May-Oct. At the parking area/trailhead, there are restroom facilities, picnic sites, and trail maps/information.\r\n\nA steady but fairly easy climb will bring you to the first level of the plateau which wraps around the base of the earthwork until about 1.6 miles into the loop, where you'll encounter the steepest grade which is short but will ultimately bring you to the top of the plateau as you enter through one of the 39 ancient openings.   \r\n\nFrom there, it is a meandering hike atop the plateau where you'll not only have a bird's eye view of the surrounding hills, but also see first-hand the remnants of the great earthen wall that was constructed thousands of years ago. Take note of the ditch on the inside of the wall and keep an eye out for the various entrances through the wall as you continue your hike.

Hoggard Trail is one of several trails within the preserve. The entrance to the park is unassuming, but I promise that you'll not be disappointed with the trails that await. The trail's namesake is derived from the early residents of this land.   \r\n\nTo access Hoggard Trail, you'll see a small parking area for 2 cars in front of the entrance sign/gate. You can either pull off there or travel about 100 yards further, and you'll see a slightly larger parking area on your left. The trailhead is found at the small parking area and begins with crossing a footbridge over a small stream.  \r\n\nThe well-marked trail will meander gently up and down through the woods as you pass a vernal pool on your left and then a small waterfall on your right. Just past this waterfall, you'll see the trail split. You may head either direction as the trail is a loop. I recommend you head left as this was the original part of the trail before it was expanded in the fall of 2016.  \r\n\nAs you continue down the trail, you'll come to remnants of a small cemetery on you right. Here the Hoggard Family is buried with many of the headstones made of unmarked or weather-worn stone. A few hundred yards south of here, the remains of the Hoggard Family home can be found.\r\n\nLeaving the cemetery, continue along the trail through a small pine grove and by an overgrown pond on your right. Follow the marked signs as you descend a slight grade and continue following the trail to your left. The trail will then begin to follow the edge of a hill overlooking State Rt 50 until you reach a bench where you can sit and contemplate Hoggard's vista.\r\n\nContinuing on the trail, you'll soon enter an awesome pine forest. You'll follow a singletrack trail as you pass under towering pines that were planted in the 1930s as part of a WPA work program to help put unemployed people to work after the Great Depression.  \r\n\nAs you exit the pine forest, you'll follow the gentle rolling contour of the land until you approach a part of the trail that skirts the sandstone cliffs of a small gorge. (Parents keep your children close.)

To that end, make sure that everyone in your group is up to the challenge.", "features": "Views", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7019130/ohio-eire-towpath-trail-looking-at-station-bridge", "ratings": {"rating": 3.7, "num_reviewers": 3}, "stats": {"dist": 23.2, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [974, 623], "alt-change": [1809, 2115], "avg-grade": 3.0, "max-grade": 29.0}},

The trail is located in the Cleveland Metroparks Bedford Reservation. The main trailhead is also technically located in the Bedford Reservation, but it's used mostly by people accessing the Summit Metro Parks Bike and Hike Trail, which runs adjacent to this trailhead. There is a secondary trailhead that is actually part of the Cuyahoga Valley National Park, and is also used to access the Ohio and Erie Canal Towpath Trail.\r\n\nThe main trailhead is located on Alexander Road, just west of the intersection with Dunham Road. The secondary trailhead is called the Frazee House Trailhead, and is located on Canal Road in the village of Valley View. You can start at either trailhead and go clockwise or counterclockwise. The following description assumes starting at Frazee House and going clockwise. \r\n\nThe first half of the loop will be mostly on the north side of Sagamore Creek, and have most of the elevation gain. The second half of the loop will be on the south side of the creek, with most of the elevation loss. Look for the main entrance to the trail in the middle of the driveway between the parking area and Canal Road. The trail is marked with posts that have a yellow salamander symbol on them.\r\n\nAbout a mile in, you cross Sagamore Creek, and head along the south bank. In about 0.2 miles, you'll see another trail going straight up a steep hill to the right. Don't take this; instead go left and cross the creek back over to the north bank.\r\n\nYou'll go up a couple of steep switchbacks to make your way up to the rim of the gorge. The trail seems to split at the corner of the second switchback, but one way (left) leads to private property. Go right instead to stay on the trail.\r\n\nJust after you get to the top of the climb, the trail forks with a doubletrack to the left and a singletrack to the right. You can take either, but the right has better views as it runs along the edge of the gorge.\r\n\nContinue along the fence when you get to the Alexander Trailhead, then up the short, steep dirt trail to the paved trail, then turn right. Go about 0.1 miles and look for the Linda Falls Trail sign on your right. This section overlaps with the Buckeye Trail. During the next mile or so is where to look for waterfalls created by a couple of smaller creeks that run into Sagamore Creek.\r\n\nNear the end, you'll head along short stretches of Sagamore Road and Canal Road to get back to Frazee House.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Spring \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Waterfall \u00b7 Wildflowers", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7028386/a-unique-double-waterfall-has-formed-in-a-bowl-of-shale-and-sandstone-along-the-", "ratings": {"rating": 4.1, "num_reviewers": 11}, "stats": {"dist": 3.8, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [839, 623], "alt-change": [229, 236], "avg-grade": 2.0, "max-grade": 16.0}},

You can head West or East along the road until you get to where the dikes comes up to the road to access the walls and stay dry the entire trip though.\r\n\nAs noted in the Restrictions section, this is a public hunting/trapping/fishing area so be mindful of the seasons when you travel through the area.\r\n\nThis must be said, the Cedar Point National Wildlife Refuge to the North and East is ONLY accessible with permits through the NWRS (link below, a great option during birding season), it is a federal mandate so do not step foot in the waters or \"explore\" down the dike walls to the East or North of the denoted trail. There are plenty of white signs along the way to identify the border. The dike wall along the border is technically refuge property but any conversation with the federal law enforcement officers recently have proven that ~5 years ago permission was granted to the State to allow better access to the Mallard Club by permitting users to have access to these border structures. The ODNR has not updated their note on the map (also linked below) to reflect this, but I have been assured it is so, just do not pass the white refuge signs.\r\n\nAs for the view, it's undeniably awesome. On any given day you could see thousands of ducks and geese in flight, deer, beavers, muskrats, turtles, snakes, songbirds...almost like it is a wildlife area or something.

It is not long, at about three miles if you include the High Meadow Spur Trail as well. The initial part of the trail is actually mowed grass but then you get into the woods proper. The trail ascends to a peak, winding through typical Ohio hardwoods, with several small creek crossings. Bridges are in place for the larger crossings, and those without bridges are basically a step across. \r\n\nAt the peak is, thoughtfully, a bench to rest from the climb or just to sit and enjoy the sounds of the forest. This is also where the High Meadow Spur Trail branches off. I'm sure it was actually a meadow at some point, but now the forest is reclaiming it. The remainder of the trail is downhill back to the parking area. \r\n\nAs the trail bottoms out for the last stretch to the lot, to the right is an unmarked spur trail, which is fairly obvious.

Its easy access from I-77 makes it a perfect and beautiful mid-drive hike to break up long drives. Doing an out and back is just over 5 miles of pretty, rolling, wooded Ohio singletrack alongside a lake. The Buckeye Trail is marked by light blue rectangular blazes throughout its 1,444 mile loop around the state of Ohio.  \r\n\nYou can park at the trailhead off Wolf Run Road. It is a small parking area which also accesses the dam that backs up the waters of Wolf Run Lake. Do not block the gate! If this area is full, you can also park one or two hundred yards east on Wold Run Road at the picnic area and take the grassy trail to this entrance.\r\n\nStart hiking down the grassy trail to the level crossing atop the dam. This first view of the lake is especially beautiful in the mornings when fog is often rolling atop the lake. Cross the dam and turn right, staying alongside the lake. As you near the woods, the trail will appear as well as a blue blaze or two. The trail continues along on the west side of the lake and does not have any trail intersections. \r\n\nThe trail can be slightly challenging to see in the fall with all the leaves, but the rest of the year is fairly clear. When in doubt, look for the blue blazes; they tend to be placed right where you might need them, including at tributary crossings.
