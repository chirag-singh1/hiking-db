This strenuous, 3-mile out-and-back (6 mile total) trail reaches these natural features after each mile of hiking, which allows you to customize your outing for a short hike or a long hike. \r\n\nThe Wildcat Rock Trail was formerly known as the Little Bearwallow Falls Trail. In 2018, Wildcat Rock Trail won the Coalition for Recreational Trails achievement award in the category of design and construction.\r\n\nTo access this trail, you'll park at the Upper Hickory Nut Gorge Trailhead and then cross the street. You'll begin by descending into an orchard (watch out for curious bears!), and quickly enter the forest, hiking alongside a babbling brook. This trail gains elevation quickly, but after about a mile of hiking, you'll find yourself at the foot of Little Bearwallow Falls. The 100-foot falls create a popular climbing spot most of the year, and an ice climbing spot in the winter. \r\n\nImmediately beyond Little Bearwallow Falls lies the most difficult part of the trail, a steep stone staircase that leads you around to the other side of the Falls. About two miles into the trail, you'll see a side trail leading up to Wildcat Rock. A short scramble away are some stunning views of the Hickory Nut Gorge. The trail continues for another 2.4 miles, passing through a  meadow beneath Bearwallow Mountain and ending at an expansive meadow on Bearwallow's summit.\r\n\nConserving Carolina partnered with Upper Hickory Nut Gorge conservation champions John Myers and Jane Lawson as well as the Brock family in 2013 to acquire and preserve 128 acres on the north slopes of Little Bearwallow Mountain. This is the land that most of the Wildcat Rock Trail crosses. John Myers and Jane Lawson protected an additional 38 acres of their property through a conservation easement with Conserving Carolina in 2017. The first mile of the Wildcat Rock Trail crosses this land. Now protected forever, Wildcat Rock tract is considered one of the most biodiverse locations in the Natural Heritage Inventory of Henderson County.", "features": "Fall Colors \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Waterfall \u00b7 Wildflowers", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7066432/love-the-rocky-areas-of-this-hike-especially-above-the-falls-area", "ratings": {"rating": 4.5, "num_reviewers": 10}, "stats": {"dist": 4.1, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [4165, 2373], "alt-change": [1911, 214], "avg-grade": 10.0, "max-grade": 29.0}},

It passes through Bentonville Battlefield, the site of the largest Civil War battle in the state, crosses three popular paddling rivers, and goes through two of Sampson County's picturesque small towns.\r\n\nThe farms of Johnston, Sampson and Cumberland counties along the route produce a diversity of products. Look for tobacco, cotton, sweet potatoes, hogs, turkeys, cattle, soybeans, and forestry. Great agricultural soils and climate, fairly flat topography, and good rainfall have led Sampson County to be ranked first in North Carolina in agricultural crops and second in livestock and poultry.\r\n\nHighlights include:\r\n\nBentonville Battlefield, now a North Carolina historic site. The trail route takes you past historical displays that help you envision the battle as it unfolded in March 1865.\r\nGreat and Little Coharie Creeks, popular paddling destinations named for the Native American tribe that is still based in Sampson County today.\r\nThe 2,100-acre White Woods Plant Conservation Preserve between Roseboro and Salemburg, which is being managed to enhance habitat for rare and endangered native plants and wildlife. The trail route follows the roads around this preserve.\r\nThe towns of Newton Grove and Roseboro. Newton Grove, first incorporated in 1879, grew up to serve the vibrant farming community in that area. Roseboro, incorporated in 1891, was built along the Cape Fear and Yadkin Valley Railroad line, which ran from Fayetteville to Wilmington.\r\nBushy Lake Natural Area, part of the NC state parks system, which is located along the trail route on Gip and Turnbull Roads in Cumberland County. \n\nThis hike is entirely on roads. Through Sampson, Bladen and Cumberland Counties, it is marked with MST blazes (a 3-inch white circle) and signs. Blazes are on the left shoulder of the road in the direction of travel, and signs are on the right side. Note that signs are often a target of theft and vandalism, and should not be relied upon exclusively for wayfinding.\r\n\nFor more information, including camping, lodging, parking, shuttles, and resupply information, as well as detailed, turn-by-turn directions, download a trail guide from the Friends of the MST.", "features": "River/Creek", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7015042/a-country-road-on-mst-segment-12b-coming-into-roseboro-photo-by-pj-wetzel-wwwpjw", "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 68.3, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [192, 79], "alt-change": [881, 880], "avg-grade": 0.0, "max-grade": 4.0}},

In other places, hikers should look for bays without standing water\u2014still with the same shape and directional alignment. The bays are named for the bay tree which grows in many of them.\r\n\nAt Turnbull Creek Educational State Forest, hikers can also learn about the naval stores industry that tapped longleaf pine for tar and turpentine until the Civil War and the role that public-land managers in Bladen County are playing today to revive the population of endangered Red-cockaded Woodpeckers.\r\n\nThe trail also features Harmony Hall Plantation, which holds one of the oldest residences in North Carolina, built before the Revolutionary War.\r\n\nThe trail through Bladen Lakes State Forest, Jones Lake State Park, and Singletary Lake State Park is marked with blazes and signs for park trails, and with the MST blaze\u2014a 3-inch white circle (in some places, a white diamond may have been used temporarily).

When you hike in a clockwise direction, the first third of the trail is mostly downhill with several fairly steep sections. The remaining two thirds of the trail ascend gradually, with a mix of uphill and level sections. When you hike in a counterclockwise direction, the first part of the trail descends gradually allowing you to breeze through the first four miles with very little effort. However, the last few miles are mostly uphill.\r\n\nParking for the trail is located in a grassy field away from the main parking area for Raven Rock State Park.

East of Pilot Mountain, the MST joins the Sauratown Trail, one of the earliest long-distance trails in the state. Winding through farmland, forests, and country roads, this trail skirts the northern flank of Sauratown Mountain. The trail is unusual in that it is mostly on private lands, and is open to trail users through the generosity of many individual landowners. As you navigate the trail, please be respectful.\r\n\nAt its eastern end, Segment 7 enters Hanging Rock State Park, the third-oldest state park in North Carolina. In the park, the MST passes within a few feet of the summit of Moore's Knob, the highest point in the Sauratown Mountains. The views from the summit fire tower are spectacular! From the rocky slopes of Moore's Knob, the trail descends through oak-hickory forest to Hanging Rock Lake, popular for swimming and boating in the summer and home to a CCC-built pavilion and bathhouse, and on to its eastern end at the Hanging Rock State Park Visitor Center.\r\n\nThis segment provides a sense of isolation that is rare in the Piedmont. There are no towns or stores on the segment, and only a few businesses of any sort. At the same time, much of the trail passes through working farmland, even within a few feet of active farm buildings. The nearest towns for resupply or lodging are Pilot Mountain, about 3 miles north of Pilot Mountain State Park; King, about 8 miles south on US 52; and Danbury, which MST Segment 8 passes through about 4 miles east of the eastern end of Segment 7.\r\n\nIn contrast to the majority of the MST, most of Segment 7 is open to horseback riders, and equestrians make up a large portion of the trail's users and advocates. All of the Sauratown Trail is equestrian trail, and the Corridor Section of Pilot Mountain State Park and the Ruben Mountain Trail (also marked as Tory's Den Trail) in the western part of Hanging Rock State Park are both open to horses. Visitors should be aware of the potential of encountering equestrians and that horses always have the right-of-way. When encountering equestrians, those on foot should calmly greet the rider and avoid quick movements to keep from frightening the horse.\r\n\nThe MST and Sauratown Trail in Segment 7 is generally very well marked with the MST blaze\u2014a 3\" white circle\u2014and Sauratown Trail signs. In a few locations, where trail is newly designated or trees have fallen, there may be gaps in the blazing, but these are rare, and the Sauratown Trails Association regularly replaces them. Because the trail is designed for equestrian use, the blazes are often higher than expected on a pedestrian-only trail. The sections of trail within Pilot Mountain and Hanging Rock State Parks, in addition to the white MST blazes, also have a second set of colored blazes corresponding to the state park trail systems.\r\n\nFor more information, including camping, lodging, parking, shuttles, and resupply information, as well as detailed, turn-by-turn directions, download a trail guide from the Friends of the Mountains-to-Sea Trail.\r\n\nThe Sauratown Trail is maintained by the Sauratown Trails Association, and the portion of Segment 7 within the state parks is maintained by Friends of the Sauratown Mountains. Both organizations hold regular trail workdays. As a result, this segment is built to very high standards, and it is a joy to explore.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Swimming \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Waterfall \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7010804/view-from-the-observation-tower-on-moores-know-hanging-rock-state-park", "ratings": {"rating": 3.6, "num_reviewers": 10}, "stats": {"dist": 37.1, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [2524, 861], "alt-change": [4646, 3803], "avg-grade": 4.0, "max-grade": 43.0}},

From there, you'll have a moderate climb the rest of the way up to where the Walkers Creek section meets the previous section.\r\n\nNote that there are no designated campsites along this section.\r\n\nThis section of the Uwharrie Trail is contributed by Brian Moore, author and creator of RidgeTrekker.com.", "features": "River/Creek \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7079008/a-straightaway-with-the-morning-sun-glistening-through-the-trees", "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 2.5, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [922, 583], "alt-change": [496, 315], "avg-grade": 6.0, "max-grade": 19.0}},

In the spring, bloodroot and trout lily kick off a festive wildlife season that begins mid-February. The preserve earns a place in The North Carolina Birding Trail: Piedmont Trail Guide, especially during migration and early breeding season. And Swift Creek itself is a playground for beaver, muskrat and an assortment of aquatic life. \n\nIn the transition from winter to spring, vernal pools that collect at the base of the bluffs offer ideal breeding grounds for spring peepers and upland chorus frogs, noted, respectively, for their high-pitched call and resemblance to a thumb being run over the tines of a comb.\n\nMake your way to the top of the bluff and take advantage of the numerous benches that turn their back on civilization (literally: the Lochmere development is less than 100 feet away).

It travels through mostly mature forest in the Pisgah National Forest or along the BRP.\r\n\nThe trail then descends to the North Fork of the Catawba River and climbs Bald Knob and Dobson Knob, some of the most challenging ascents on the entire MST. From these heights, visitors see some of the most spectacular views of the region, from Lake James to Little Switzerland.\r\n\nThe next part of the trail offers views of the spectacular Linville Gorge, descending to the Linville River on the west side then climbing to the eastern lip of the gorge at Shortoff Mountain and following its eastern edge. Because this popular part of the trail has had frequent forest fires, there are stretches with little water or shade from the Linville River until descending again at Table Rock.\r\n\nThe Linville River is approximately 60 yards wide at the crossing point. The water is usually at least knee deep, but it can be much higher and dangerous after rains and in cold weather. The directions in the Friends of the Mountains-to-Sea Trail guide described below offer an alternate route to cross the river via a bridge if you reach the river when it is at dangerous levels.\r\n\nThe trail dips into remote wild-trout waters located in areas nominated for wilderness status. It follows tributaries in the western Wilson Creek basin to the confluence of Harper Creek and Raider Camp Creek and then climbs along Harper Creek before hopping over a ridge to Lost Cove Creek and Gragg Prong. The trail follows these streams until it nears the BRP at Grandmother Mountain and Beacon Heights. Much of this part of the trail travels alongside crashing wild streams and rocky outcrops, which also offer spectacular cascades and waterfalls. This area was heavily timbered in the early 20th century and the trail often follows the old roads and railroad beds. One may look for traces of once vigorous human activity among the resurgent timber, in the sagging banks of these passages, and in the hints of washed-out and vanished bridges and settlements and wonder how nature has reclaimed these valleys and coves.\r\n\nIf you are interested in an overnight backpacking trip, this segment may be divided into 4 sections of roughly similar lengths. The first 19.6-mile section is between Black Mountain Campground and US 221 at the Forest Service Work Center at Woodlawn. The second 13.6-mile section is between US 221 at Woodlawn Work Center and Old NC 105. The third 19.6-mile section is between Old NC 105 and NC 181. The fourth 22.5-mile section is between NC 181 and Beacon Heights on the Blue Ridge Parkway.\r\n\nMuch of this segment travels through wilderness areas, so even MST blazing, a 3\" white circle, may be sparse.

If tallest-peak-in-the-east Mount Mitchell is the crowning jewel of the range, then the 11.5 mile Black Mountain Crest Trail is the strand of pearls. Five of the top ten highest peaks in the east adorn this lofty ridge. Do a quick web search and one finds that the Black Mountain Crest Trail always comes with superlatives. Most describe pain and difficulty. Think critically about your water strategy and take lightning storms seriously. The trail is most aesthetically done as a one way, starting at Bowlen's Creek and ending at the summit of Mt. Mitchell.\r\n\nFor the full climbing experience, start at Bowlen's Creek Trailhead. Your destination is the summit of Mt. Mitchell. Stash a car or arrange for a ride from the summit parking area of Mt Mitchell.  Locate Bowlen's Creek Trailhead by finding Water Shed Drive (marked \"PVT\" on the street sign). Unless you have high clearance 4x4, use the two-car pull off on the right not far from the main road. The trailhead and several primitive camping spots are another 300-400 yards up the rough road.\r\n\nThe initial climb from Bowlen's Creek to Celo Knob is the physical crux. Expect a 3000 ft gain with lots of heavy breathing. Your reward after 4 miles of climbing is a beautiful meadow with see-forever views in every direction. For bonus points, you can scramble on a side track to the bushy summit of Celo Knob. Good luck finding the Geological Survey Marker on the summit.\r\n\nMile eight is Deep Gap and it is significant for two reasons. First, it is the only legitimate camping spot on the trail. Second, and most importantly, it is the only spot to replenish your water supply. Don't expect a gusher in most seasons. To locate the water spring, take the Colbert Ridge Trail (which intersects the BMC trail at Deep Gap) for a short distance, probably less than 100 meters. A small rock/cave is where the spring is located. Your next water source is the Mount Mitchell Summit, assuming the bathrooms are open.\r\n\nFrom Deep Gap, it's onward and upward to Potato Hill. Don't let the lowly name fool you. It's a crusher of a climb. The next four, 6,000+ ft peaks on the ridge start passing more easily. Enjoy the black fir forests filled with weathered stone and leafy ferns. A sense of the ancient abounds here.\r\n\nAn easier trail section and picnic tables are the sure sign that your wilderness hike is almost over. Mt Mitchell and the inevitable tourists who have driven up in their cars await you. Take the short ramp to the summit and try not to gloat.", "features": "Cave \u00b7 Spring \u00b7 Views \u00b7 Wildflowers \u00b7 Wildlife", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7030143/afternoon-sun-streaming-through-the-trees-on-the-crest-trail", "ratings": {"rating": 4.3, "num_reviewers": 6}, "stats": {"dist": 11.7, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [6623, 3085], "alt-change": [4901, 1395], "avg-grade": 10.0, "max-grade": 50.0}},

There is also parking along FR211. Continue on FR 3509. The road soon turns into Green Ridge Trail. \r\n\nEnjoy your ascent up the lush, enclosed drainage. The singletrack is some of the softest I've found out east. The trees are blazed yellow fairly regularly. It is obvious the trail is infrequently used or maintained but there is no trouble following it and the blazes are always there to lead the way. \r\n\nIf accessing from the AT, the trail can be challenging to find, but if you follow the map on the Hiking Project mobile app, you'll find the trail and the blazes as you climb toward Green Ridge know. The trail access seems to be a little further north than indicated on the app, but otherwise it is fairly dead on, and once you are on the trail, even though it may be faint, it is easy enough to follow. After Green Ridge knob, the trail is very easy to follow. \r\n\nStop and enjoy an amazing view from the knob. It was a rainy day when we were there and the clouds were all low in the valleys, with the peaks, covered in fall foliage rising up above those clouds, looking like islands in a vast sea.

Turn left at 5 Maples and follow the trail as it climbs steadily for 3.4 miles to last steep climb called Grace's Ladder.\r\n\nAlong the route, there are two creek crossings. The forest consists of hardwoods and evergreens. The terrain varies with technical rocks and roots to smooth, soft grassy sections. The views from Grace's Ladder are phenomenal. You can see the Great Smoky Mountains to the west and the full Black Mountain Range on the east. Depending on the time of year, you'll see wildflowers, fall colors, or the gray, leafless trees in the winter. \r\n\nThe highlight of this hike is a short detour at 2.3 miles to the abandoned Mica Mine.

Across the dam, follow the trail as it heads north along the east side of the lake.  The trail is a mix of paved greenway trail and boardwalks over the lake.  Along the lake are neighborhoods and apartment complexes, but there are enough trees and wildlife to forget you're in the city.\r\n\nAs you approach the northern end of the lake, it becomes more swampy and there are a number of water birds in the shallow waters.  Mallard ducks and Canada geese are the most common, but herons, cormorants and osprey can also be seen.  At the northeast corner of the lake, a connector trail leads to the Community Center.  Turn left instead and stay on the boardwalks to loop around the west side of the lake.  There are a number of coves that the trail crosses on boardwalks which provide more great opportunities to see wildlife.  In warmer weather, turtles congregate on exposed branches to bask in the sun.  \r\n\nAs you get back around to the dam, the Hare Snipe Creek Trail continues south to Lynn Road.

Mileage signs have been installed every quarter of a mile along the trail to help trail users know how far they have traveled and how much farther it is to their destination. Benches, water fountains, and three bicycle FixIt Stations are available along the trail. Blue light phones have been installed along the greenway for the safety of all users.\r\n\nThe Greenway winds through wetlands, meadows and forests through Hendersonville.

At mile .2, the Crib Gap Trail intersects the trail from the left. You'll pass the horse camp, where people camp with their horses before going out on adventures. The trail enters a hemlock forest until you cross Anthony Creek for the first time at mile .6. The trail moves ahead through rhododendron forests until a log bridge crosses Anthony Creek again.

The trail quickly comes to the Russell Field Trail junction, which goes off to the right and leads up to Russell Field on the Appalachian Trail (AT).  The Anthony Creek trail continues straight ahead as it continues between Anthony Ridge and Cold Water Knob. The trail begins to narrow as it climbs to mile 2.0, where the final crossing of Anthony Creek happens. At mile marker 2.9, you reach Campsite #9, which has room for several small groups and plenty of water from Anthony Creek.\r\n\nLeaving the campsite, the trail climbs steeply for about .6 mile until it reaches Bote Mountain. It's a strenuous climb, but also provides great views, especially in the winter. All of this area is second growth forest because it was logged before the area became a national park.  The views are beginning to diminish, but you can get an idea of what it must have been like to look out towards Cades Cove far below where the trail works its way through the woods.\r\n\nOnce you arrive at the Bote Mountain Trail junction, you can go to the right and climb another 1.7 miles until you reach Spence Field.

The trail is wide in this portion because it was used by the power company to service power lines going into Cades Cove. At mile .6, the trail goes through Indian Grave Gap and you pass an old road that may have been the old Rich Mountain Road that the settlers used. \r\n\nFrom there, the trail climbs more steeply (1000 feet in a mile) as the pine forest transforms into a hardwood forest with oaks, maples, silverbells, and other trees.

As the trail departs the gap, a small side trail leads off to the left to Bull Cave.  Bull Cave is very deep and requires a permit from the National Park Service to enter due to threat of White Nose Syndrome to the bats that live there. Legend has it that a bull fell into the cave during a cattle drive one summer, and thus the name Bull Cave. There is also a large sinkhole in the area, a reflection of the limestone underlying the area. As the main trail moves through the forest, its fairly flat making for a pleasant journey in the woods.  Even though there arent sweeping views most of the year on this trail, in the fall, its a great place to get away from the crowds and view the fall colors. Winter offers better views, but they are obscured by trees.\n\nAt 2.3 miles, the trail approaches the park boundary and drops through Kelly Gap, where Campsite #4 existed.  Campsite #4 and Campsite #7, which is further along the trail, were closed down by the park service several years ago and are not open for overnight camping.  Private homes can be seen on the other side of the park boundary, examples of what the area would be like if it wasnt a national park.

It follows the Left Prong of Anthony Creek as it begins to climb from Cades Cove to the Appalachian Trail. It crosses several spring branches, which can be easily crossed by rock hop, as it begins to ascend through rhododendron and hemlock stands.\r\n\nAs the trail continues, around .9 miles you'll have to cross the Left Prong a couple of times.

Campsite 10 lies just ahead with easy access to the Left Prong or a small spring branch for water.\r\n\nAt this point, the trail continues to climb, but it's more difficult due to it being steeper, and because of heavy horse use.

You'll want to plan accordingly in advance for these crossings.  The wide trail is in good condition and climbs only moderately, making for a pleasant experience.  \r\n\nBone Valley got its name in the late 1800's, when a herd of cattle took shelter from a blizzard and froze to death;  when the snow melted, their carcasses littered the valley and were eventually picked clean by wild animals with the bones remaining for many years.\r\n\nHikers will see reminders of the logging trains that once through the valley.  At the end of the trail is the Hall cabin, the most-remote remaining structure in the GSMNP.  This cove was first settled by Jesse \"Crate\" and Polly Hall about 1877, building a small cabin around 1880 and another larger cabin around 1892, in part to house their 13 children.  The sign notwithstanding, the remaining structure is the later cabin which was moved slightly and renovated by the Park Service.  The cabin is open and observant hikers will note that the renovation did not include rebuilding the chimney.\r\n\nIn the woods just to the right of the cabin are the remains of the Kress hunting lodge.

The trail briefly levels, affording hikers a break before returning to steeper climbing along the ridgeline to Woodward Knob.\r\n\nBeyond Woodward Knob, the trail descends considerably, levels momentarily, and then launches a long, steep climb to Cherry Knob. This section of trail is dominated by oaks which provide shade for scattered pockets of flowers. After clearing Cherry Knob in a sharp right-handed turn, the trail drops into a slight gap that anchors the upper end of the Haw Gap Branch as it feeds downslope. The sparse remains of an old log structure can be seen nearby on the flat of the ridge.\r\n\nAfter another mile of steep climbing, the trail enters the grassy bald of Haw Gap. During the summer months, the trail through the gap can be difficult to discern because of tall weedy ground cover. The exit from the bald passes a weak stream before entering a moderate descent that is frequently rocky and sporadically encumbered by weeds. As it descends, the trail offers several panoramic glimpses of the high Smoky divide.\r\n\nTwo easy stream crossings precede a drop into the moist environs of Meadow Gap, where the headwaters of Gunna Creek gather. The Gunna Creek crossing signals the start of a long moderate climb angling across the headwall of the Eagle Creek watershed. Here, the trail runs on the southern fringe of a great grassy bald that is steadily receding to encroaching trees and shrubs.\r\n\nA mile-and-a-half above the Gunna Creek crossing, the Jenkins Ridge Trail emerges from a rhododendron thicket into the openness of Spence Field and immediately terminates into the Appalachian Trail near a fine vantage point.\r\n\nThis content was contributed by author Ken Wise.

The grade is steep, cluttered with loose stones, and often saturated from channels escaping the stream.\r\n\nThe lower stretch of the Cold Spring Gap Trail is a deceiving prelude to the rough conditions ahead. From the intersection with the Hazel Creek Trail, the trail follows an old wagon trace that descends gradually to a difficult crossing of Hazel Creek. At the crossing, the creek is well over 10 yards wide and can easily exceed three feet deep when running high. \r\n\nAfter crossing Hazel Creek, the trail climbs gradually through a scattering of old homesites tucked in among the lower contours of High Rocks Ridge, before merging onto an abandoned railroad grade. Just over a mile past the Hazel Creek crossing, the trail completes a long sharp switchback, upstream, to the left.\r\n\nFrom this point, the grade markedly steepens and the way is wet and difficult. Feeder streams and seepages have washed away the soil, leaving a rough track of exposed water-slickened rocks to scramble over.\r\n\nAs the trail progresses, the grade continues to steepen. Occasionally overflow from the Cold Spring Gap escapes into the trail making it difficult to gain traction. A footbridge in one of the wetter places does little to help, as the wet wood is slicker than the wet rocks. Altogether, the trail here is an exceedingly difficult and exhausting climb.\r\n\nDespite the arduous conditions, the boulder strewn slopes flanking the trail are oddly attractive. Minimal undergrowth and stands of tall slender poplars allow hikers an unobscured field of view. A mile past the switchback the trail makes the first of two crossings with the Cold Spring Branch. Progress is difficult here as the ground is often rutted and muddy. When it rains, the track becomes a mess of shifting stones and mire. Conditions do become a bit drier as elevation is gained, but the steepness and ruts remain.\r\n\nThe final 300 yard climb into Cold Spring Gap is perceptibly steeper. The trail over this stretch is wide, rocky, and littered with ruts. Once in the gap, the trail intersects the lower terminus of the Welch Ridge Trail.\r\n\nThis content was contributed by author Ken Wise.

Close by, ridgelines and overhanging rhododendron block out the direct sunlight, casting the hollow in a perpetual shadow.\r\n\nThe trail continues a quarter-mile until coming in sight of the Goldmine Branch embayment of Fontana Lake.

Fifty yards above the crossing, the trail enters Backcountry Camp 70, Jonas Creek.\r\n\nUpon leaving the campsite, the trail enters a pleasant stream-side excursion following an old logging grade. Just shy of a half-mile, the trail crosses the stream in a difficult rock-hop, proceeds 145 yards, then switches back across the stream in another rock-hop. At this juncture, the trail angles sharply to enter a narrow steep-sided cove.\r\n\nFrom here the trail and stream begin to run closely together. In places the stream takes over the trail, making the hiking wet and messy. Up ahead, the trail makes two additional crossings - both crossings can be difficult when water is running high. After another 215 yards, the trail crosses Jonas Creek for the fifth and final time, now on a footlog, and then turns away from the stream for a steep course along Little Jonas Creek up the eastern flank of Welch Ridge.\r\n\nA quarter-mile up Little Jonas Branch, the trail crosses the stream and begins following Yanu Branch. The grade becomes noticeably steeper as the trail winds through a landscape of scattered boulders. Just beyond a footlog over Yanu Branch, the trail begins negotiating a series of grade-mitigating switchbacks, remnants of the logging railroad. Four switchbacks follow in quick succession and then, after a quarter-mile interval, another pair.

Dating back to the early 1830's, Hazel Creek was settled by early pioneers and prior to that, Cherokee Indians. Growing with time, the area eventually became a bustling mining and log milling town. Remnants of the old town and life on Hazel Creek are scattered throughout. Old chimneys, stoves, and foundations can be observed all over. \r\n\nCovering a distance of almost 16 miles, the Hazel Creek Trail has a variety to offer. The biggest part of the lower section of the trail is an old roadbed with bridges crossing streams making for an easy outing; however, the northern section of the trail is much more difficult. The northern section changes from an old roadbed to a singletrack trail with numerous creek crossings, overgrown trails, and steep switchbacks. Be warned that navigating the northern section of the trail following a large rain storm can be very difficult and dangerous given the many stream crossing some of which are 2-3 feet deep. \r\n\nAlong the trail there are several backcountry camp sites listed including 86, 85, 84, 83, and 82. These campsites don't offer much as they are backcountry camps. A stone fire ring and a bear line to hang your food are about the most that one can expect. These sites must be rented through the Great Smoky Mountains National Park Backcountry office. \r\n\nThe area is teeming with various wildlife. While in the area I observed black bear, deer, grouse, and fox. There are gorgeous plants and open stream views throughout the trail. Take time to enjoy all that the trail has to offer. Fishing is allowed throughout Hazel Creek but beware that if it rains before or during your trip the streams can become large and fast making it difficult to fish. Numerous streams feed into Hazel Creek and there are several trails that connect to Hazel Creek Trail including: Welch Ridge Trail, Cold Spring Gap Trail, Bone Valley Trail, Jenkins Ridge Trail, and the Lakeshore Trail. \r\n\nHazel Creek Trail only has 3 access points: hiking to the trail using the Lakeshore Trail and  Welch Ridge Trail at either end of the trail, one of the many connecting trails or by boat from the Fontana Lake Marina ( fontanavillage.com/shuttle-\u2026) which will shuttle you to Ollie Cove Trail to access Hazel Creek Trail.

Another access point is to park in Cades Cove and head out on the Crooked Arm Ridge Trail to meet up with the trail, as described here.  If you are looking for a quiet trail without the crowd, this is the one for you.\r\n\nAs you depart the  Crooked Arm Ridge Trail/ Indian Grave Gap Trail junction, you'll pass under the old power lines that brought power into Cades Cove as well as some rhododendron tangles that provide relief from the sun on hot summer days. You'll encounter Campsite #6, which is good if you get a late start. The trail goes by a small spring that provides water for the camp, and then continues through the woods. Like most forests in the park, this area was harvested in the early 1900s before becoming part of the National Park. You'll find newer trees growing in this area as the forest continues to recover from the logging efforts. The trail continues downhill until you start nearing the park boundary. At this point, the trail narrows and begins to ascend for a little bit. Erosion in this area can make it tricky to navigate, so make sure you are paying attention.\r\n\nOnce the trail starts to descend again around .8 miles, you move through a rhododendron jungle as it thins in favor of ferns and mosses. You need to rock hop a small spring, and then the trail begins to switchback as you move away from the ridgeline.  The trail is all descent from this point until about mile marker 2.7. The trail will pass Whiteoak Sink between 2.5 and 2.75 miles and a famous cave called the \"blow hole.\" Due to White Nose Syndrome, a disease that infects bats, the cave is closed to humans.  \r\n\nThe trail begins to rise as you encounter the park boundary, which you follow for the final .5 miles to the junction with the Schoolhouse Gap Trail. You'll pass several cottages or homes that lie just outside the park boundary, a reminder of what the park would be like today if it wasn't protected.  Finally, after 3.5 miles, you have reached the end of the trail.\r\n\nYou can return via the path you came, or you can take Schoolhouse Gap Trail back to Laurel Creek Road and catch a ride from there.

At this juncture, the Wet Bottom Trail turns right onto the light-gravel track, crosses the stream on a short footlog, then proceeds in the direction of the Elijah Oliver Place. About 75 yards beyond the stream, the trail passes in front of a large barn built by John Oliver sometime around 1900.\r\n\nDown the gravel track, the Wet Bottom Trail exits to the left and follows a faint singletrack into the woods.\t\r\n\nWhen the Wet Bottom Trail exits the gravel track, it winds through an old field once tilled and planted with tobacco and corn by Elijah Oliver.

A ways into the bend, the trail crosses Eagle Creek on a long slender footlog. This is the first of eighteen stream crossings that grace the Eagle Creek Trail. \r\n\nAfter crossing the stream 3 times, the trail continues on to the Lower Ekaneetlee Backcountry Campsite (#89), situated on the site of the former Montvale Logging Camp 9. On leaving the campsite, the Eagle Creek Trail immediately crosses Ekaneetlee Creek a few feet above the stream\u2019s confluence with Eagle Creek.\r\n\nNavigate a series of stream crossings alongside forest and farm fields before entering the Eagle Creek Island Backcountry Campsite (#96). After completing another series of stream crossings, the trail enters a narrow creek bottom that once housed Montvale Camp 11. Various pieces of logging equipment including a circular sawmill blade, steel cables, logging hooks, and washtubs can be found on the side of the trail where it enters the Big Walnut Backcountry Campsite (#97). Above the campsite, the trail crosses Gunna Creek near an upper annex of the Big Walnut Camp.\r\n\nOn leaving the Big Walnut Camp, the trail follows Gunna Creek before easing into a switchback placing the trail on a narrow berm high over the stream. The trail remains on this higher trajectory for a short time before returning to a streamside course. It then follows Gunna Creek for a mile before crossing the stream twice more. A series of switchbacks over the next mile work the trail to a higher elevation where it crosses Gunna Creek for the final time. From this juncture, the trail edges away from Gunna Creek following the old railroad berm into boulder-strewn terrain.\r\n\nAbove the boulders, the trail switches away from the drainage to pursue a steep, wet, and slippery course along Spence Field Branch. Here the terrain is heavily congested with boulders and shaded by hardwood forest. At the one point where the trail levels out momentarily, offering a brief respite from the climbing, it crosses Spence Field Branch.\r\n\nThick grass appearing at the trail\u2019s edge heralds the long final approach to Spence Field. The trail follows the stream before turning up into a steep climb approaching a small spring and the Spence Field Shelter. The Eagle Creek Trail passes in front of the shelter and out into the open bald of Spence Field before terminating in an intersection with the Appalachian Trail (AT).\r\n\nThis content was contributed by author Ken Wise.

The Cherokee had both lived and made summer camps along these creeks for at least one thousand years.  It wasn't until 1830 that the first non-Cherokees were documented in the area. Hazel Creek was allegedly named after the American Hazelnut trees growing along its banks.\r\n\nTrail Description: Lost Cove CS 90 (mile 200.6) is along the edge of Eagle Creek and close to where the creek enters Fontana Lake. From the campsite, follow the Lakeshore Trail east toward Eagle Creek. Cross over Lost Cove Creek on a log bridge, then Eagle Creek on a steel bridge, then turn right at the trail sign. The Eagle Creek Trail continues straight. Climb up over a ridge, then down the other side to the Possum Hollow CS 88 at mile 203.6. Look for evidence of old homesteads along this section. Cross another series of low ridges and come to the Hazel Creek Trail intersection in the old village of Proctor at mile 204.9. Cross the Proctor Bridge over Hazel Creek to reach the Proctor Campsite 86 at mile 205.0. All that is left of the old Hazel community are a few foundations and the Calhoun House. You can visit, but do not camp in the Calhoun House, built in 1928 by Granville Calhoun, a railroad builder for the Ritter Lumber Company.\r\n\nCampsites: Three campsites are along this section, Lost Cove Campsite 90 at mile 200.1, Possum Hollow Campsite 88 (no horses) at mile 203.6, and Proctor Campsite 86 at mile 205.0, which is located on the old baseball field for the town of Proctor. Campsite reservations must be made in advance through the GSMNP Backcountry Office online reservation system.\r\n\nWater Sources: Each campsite has water which should be treated and there are several creek crossings where water is available. Lost Cove Campsite 90 is heavily used. Proctor Campsite 86 gets its water from Hazel Creek.", "features": "Commonly Backpacked \u00b7 Fall Colors \u00b7 Views", "condition": "Unknown"}, "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 4.9, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [2340, 1711], "alt-change": [817, 796], "avg-grade": 6.0, "max-grade": 26.0}},

To access this trail, make your way 1.1 miles out the Forney Ridge Trail to reach the Forney Creek Trail junction.\r\n\nForney Creek Trail follows an old logging railroads that were used to heavily log this area before it became part of the national park. The trail descends steeply (1700 feet in 2.5 miles) as it follows the high ridge down the mountain.  After a quick view of Clingmans Dome, the trail descends through a red spruce forest that gradually transforms into a hemlock forest as the elevation changes. The trail nears Forney Creek, but moves away from the creek instead of crossing it. You come to the first crossing of Forney Creek, which consists of a rail holding rocks in place. Looking up the creek, you can see a series of cascades surrounded by rhododendron. From this point, the trail follows a railroad bed and evidence (cables, buckets, etc) of the logging companies can be seen around the trail. At 2.0 miles, Forney Creek goes down Rock Slab Falls, a spectacular cascade.\r\n\nThe creek continues to get larger as the trail moves down the mountain. The trail passes campsite 68b at 2.4 miles, and then crosses the creek several times as it moves through creek valleys and gullies. After passing campsite 69 at mile 6, there is a creek crossing that requires wading followed by another creek crossing that can be tricky in high water.  After this, the trail runs along the left side of Forney Creek until it comes to a foot log that crosses the creek. At mile 7.4, Campsite 70 lies between Forney Creek and Jonas Creek. More creeks flow into Forney Creek as the trail begins level out.  At mile 8.6, campsite 71 sits on the left hand side of the trail and is the location of the old Bee Gum CCC camp.

You'll notice these dead trees throughout the Clingmans Dome area. \r\n\nThe rocky and root strewn trail continues to descend until it levels out along the ridge. Throughout this section of the trail, various wildflowers bloom in the spring and then later in the summer, and raspberries and blackberries ripen as the season progresses towards fall. \r\n\nAt 1.1 miles, the Forney Creek Trail breaks off to the right as it makes its way to the Lakeshore Trail. Our trail, Forney Ridge Trail, continues straight at the junction. The trail can be very muddy and eroded in places, so the Friends of the Smokies have put in log trails in sections to help combat this problem.

Formations of upthrust rock comprise much of the immediate terrain, making the trail itself rough and rocky in places.\r\n\nOne mile below the road, the trail turns onto an east-facing slope affording some fine views across the Deep Creek watershed and into a veritable sea of mountains ranging deep into North Carolina. Here, the trail completes a series of switchbacks before regaining the spine of Fork Ridge. Along the ridge, the grade moderates nicely. Visible to the left is a short section of Newfound Gap Road running along the crest of the Thomas Divide. On the right is the upper end of the Noland Divide.\r\n\nThe trail remains on the spine of Fork Ridge for only a quarter-mile before rolling off to the right into a long steady descent that roughly parallels the ridgeline. Here, the rushing of Left Fork becomes clearly audible in the gorge below. As it continues descending, the trail circumnavigates a minor ridge point, circling to the left and quickly arriving at a narrow neck in Fork Ridge known as Deep Creek Gap.\r\n\nIn the day of the Smoky Mountain hunter, Deep Creek Gap was a major landmark, being the only convenient place of passage between the upper reaches of Deep Creek and Left Fork. Well-known camps were situated on both sides of the gap.\r\n\nAt Deep Creek Gap, the trail becomes exceedingly steep, dropping through a cove to Deep Creek. As it approaches the stream, the trail winds through a small patch of nettle-infested boggy ground before reaching a slight hummock at the edge of the stream.\r\n\nFrom the hummock, the trail proceeds across Deep Creek in a difficult crossing and then immediately terminates into the Deep Creek Trail. Fifty yards downstream, the Deep Creek Trail enters the Poke Patch Backcountry Campsite (#53), one of the oldest camps in the Smoky backcountry.\r\n\nThis content was contributed by author Ken Wise.

Due to its location, chances are you might be the only one on the trail.\r\n\nThe trail climbs for about half a mile through the forest until it starts to level off. As the trail levels off, you enter a grassy area that provides great views and blueberries, blackberries, and huckleberries in August. The trees in this area are relatively young, as this area was logged by the lumber companies. A fire swept through this area destroying much of the habitat, and creating areas like Charlies Bunion. You'll notice that as the trail goes through the meadow, it sinks below the area around it because of horse use and erosion. The way can be rocky in this section, so watch your step.\r\n\nNow the trail starts it descent as it makes its way toward Smokemont and the junction with Cabin Flats Trail.  At mile 1.3, you reach the junction of the Grassy Branch Trail. From here, you can make your way down to the Kephart Shelter (2.5 miles away) by turning right, or continue straight ahead toward Smokemont (7.1 miles away).  Norway spruce trees, planted by the Champion Lumber Company, may be seen in this area, at least until the national park can remove this exotic species.  \r\n\nThe trail follows Richland Mountain ridge, getting rocky and muddy as you descend. This cooler, wetter environment makes for good wildflower viewing in the spring and summer. The trail crosses Bradley Fork via a rock hop, and you enter a ravine that escaped logging and fire due to its moist, sheltered environment. This section is just one example of a few of the old growth forests that exist in the park.\r\n\nThe trail continues to be rocky as it descends along the creeks in the area. Rock hops are usually easy unless it's been raining or there is a lot of snow melt. You continue descending until you come to a log bridge that crosses the Tennessee Branch of Bradley Fork. You descend through a ravine, crossing the creek several times via logs or rock hops. Finally, you get to a point where the trail narrows and creek stays on your right hand side.

When it leaves the Bradley Fork Trail, the Chasteen Creek Trail follows a level track of loose stone for 130 yards before intersecting an access path on the right leading to the Lower Chasteen Backcountry Campsite (#50), one of the nicer campsites in the park.\r\n\nThe trail continues beyond the campsite on its wide level track for 200 yards before crossing Chasteen Creek on a wooden bridge. At this juncture, the grade stiffens noticeably as the trail charts a course parallel to the stream. About a half-mile above the bridge, an access path drops down sharply from the left side of the trail heading to Chasteen Creek Falls, a fifty-foot waterslide attractively sequestered in heavy thickets of woody undergrowth and large second-growth hemlocks and poplars. The rock surface over which the falls flow is not steeply pitched, and thus the stream does not display a forceful plunge.\r\n\nBeyond the access to the falls, the Chasteen Creek Trail continues climbing while edging away from the main stream to follow an upstream course along a nameless tributary. The trail soon crosses the tributary at a switchback. Beyond the crossing, the trail becomes considerably rockier and narrows appreciably. Following the tributary downstream, it returns to Chasteen Creek, turns, and resumes its upstream course.\r\n\nFor the next mile, the trail continues climbing steeply while maintaining a course high above Chasteen Creek. When the trail descends to the stream, it actually crosses a headwater tributary of Chasteen Creek and then immediately intersects an access path leading into the Upper Chasteen Backcountry Campsite (#48).\r\n\nAbove the campsite, the steep climb resumes while the track degenerates into a bed of large loosely shifting stones that roll underfoot. After almost a half-mile, the trail diminishes to a single-file track and then begins negotiating at irregular intervals a series of switchbacks and feeder streams. Except for a couple of excursions through dry-ridge conditions, second-growth hardwoods remain the primary forest cover. A mile and a half above the campsite, the trail rolls up onto the crest of Hughes Ridge and terminates into the lower terminus of the Hughes Ridge Trail.\r\n\nThis content was contributed by author Ken Wise.

The trail climbs 2,300 feet from the shelter to the Appalachian Trail. It's a heck of a hike, but some of the views make the work worth it. Work in the last 5-6 years has greatly improved the trail by adding steps, drainage, and retaining walls.\r\n\nThe trail immediately crosses the creek and then starts to move away from the creek. The forest around you is a second growth forest due to heavy logging by the Champion Fibre Company in the early 1900s. The trail, described as a hard-packed dirt trail, starts to climb as it follows the mountain. The trail gets narrow and rockier for a short while before it joins an old railroad bed and levels out for a short while. After going through a dry creek bed, you begin to hear the sound of Sweat Heifer Creek at 1.6 miles. This is a great place to enjoy the creek, grab a bite to eat, and rest before continuing your trek uphill.\r\n\nThe trail climbs up the hillside and offers views of the creek that you just crossed. The trail leaves the railroad bed and climbs along a hillside that can be full of wildflowers in the spring. Leaving the moisture of the creeks behind, the trail emerges on a dry ridge and turns to the right. A view of the crest, where the AT wanders, comes into view as the trail gets rough and root-filled due to erosion. The trail starts to level out as you approach the Appalachian Trail (AT) and the end of your climbing.\r\n\nFrom here, you have several options. Turning right takes you toward Charlies Bunion and the Dry Sluice Gap Trail  which can be used with Grassy Branch Trail to take you back to the Kephart Prong Shelter.

The slopes flanking the stream were denuded of trees by the Parson Pulp and Lumber Company through the 1920s. Over the eighty years since Parson departed from the Smokies, yellow poplars have proven to be the most prolific tree species regenerating along Straight Fork. In springtime, wildflowers are abundant on the lower slopes.\r\n\nSoon the trail turns away from the stream, becoming markedly steeper, and degenerating to an uneven rocky course, particularly where feeder streams and seepages leach away the soil. After winding among the contours for a little more than a mile, the trail proceeds to the back of a hollow and crosses Grass Branch, where the stream trickles off a rock ledge and out onto the trail. At this juncture, the trail diminishes to a single-file track angling steeply up and across the flank of Hyatt Ridge. In wintertime or at openings in the forest cover, the long curvature of Balsam Mountain is visible across the Straight Fork drainage.\r\n\nThe trail proceeds with little variation in grade for slightly over a mile before leveling out momentarily and entering into what initially appears to be a gap. This occurrence, known in Smoky Mountain parlance as a \u201cfalse gap,\u201d is noticeable when approaching the point of a finger ridge, particularly one that is level and fairly free of forest cover. As the trail rises to cross the ridge point, it often appears to the hiker to be a characteristic gap in the ridgeline which harbors an intersection marking the trail\u2019s end. On a steep climb such as the Beech Gap Trail, false gaps often give rise to false hopes. As a seasoned Smoky Mountaineer once expressed it, \u201cYou\u2019ll thank you\u2019re thar, but ye ain\u2019t.\u201d\r\n\nAt the false gap, the trail turns sharply left and climbs through open forests littered with fallen boles of American chestnut trees. More remarkable, however, are the extensive patches of trillium that blanket the slopes on both sides of the trail for several hundred yards. Here, the trail remains a narrow file, but the track ameliorates to a softer cushion underfoot. The appearance of red spruce trees heralds the approach into a true gap where the Beech Gap Trail terminates in an intersection with the Hyatt Ridge Trail.\r\n\nThis content was contributed by author Ken Wise.

Beyond the turnaround, the trail traverses to Heintooga Overlook, which affords superb views across the Raven Fork drainage to Mount Guyot and the high Smoky divide.\r\n\nPast Heintooga Overlook, the trail leaves the roadbed and drops off right onto a narrow, hard-packed dirt track that descends gently through a forest and into a bottomland to cross Flat Creek on a footlog. After a series of soggy stream crossings, the trail continues its gentle descent for a half-mile before approaching an access path to Flat Creek Falls exiting on the right.\r\n\nFlat Creek Falls is a definite must-see in the Smokies, as the ruggedness, steepness, and rushing fall of the water, all compacted in a small isolated niche, engenders a wonderfully pleasant wilderness experience.\r\n\nAt the top of Flat Creek Falls, the only good vantage point is a rock platform on the far side of the stream that can be difficult to reach. The platform is along the top of a steeply angled, smooth rock shield about fifteen feet wide at the top and tapering over a distance of twenty-five feet to the narrow channel below. Flat Creek descends from a ledge into a small pool and then onto the shield, where it glides evenly and with little sound or turbulence, a deceiving prelude to the violently rushing torrent that follows below.\r\n\nAt the point where the Flat Creek Trail passes the access path to the falls, it begins a short climb over a low ridge that separates the Flat Creek drainage from that of Bunches Creek. A half-mile beyond the access to Flat Creek Falls, the trail crosses Bunches Creek twice on a footlog before starting into a short but steep climb to terminate at Heintooga Ridge Road.\r\n\nThis content was contributed by author Ken Wise.

Smokemont, a contraction for Smoky Mountains, was originally a lumber company village for the Champion Fibre Company, first called Bradleytown for the Bradley family who settled the area, then later called Luftee, for the Oconaluftee River which runs through the area. As a lumber company town, the area was abandoned in 1939, after the area was purchased for the development of the GSMNP. Now the area is a busy national park campground. The Primitive Baptist Church dates back to those early years.\r\n\nTrail Description: At the bridge over the river, the entrance to the Smokemont Campground at mile 254.7, the BMT heads straight up the hill to the Primitive Baptist Church, skirts the campground, then turns north (left) meeting the Bradley Fork Trail at mile 256.4. Backcountry permits can be obtained using the phone at the Backcountry Registration kiosk at the entrance to the campground. The Bradley Fork Trail is a gently rising old roadbed along the stream. At mile 257.1 the Chasteen Creek Trail junction is reached. Turn right onto this trail, and soon you'll reach the Lower Chasteen Creek Campsite #50 at mile 257.2. The lower one mile of this trail is often muddy. At mile 257.8 there is a side trail to a Chasteen Creek Cascade. Soon thereafter, the trail begins to climb steadily on a narrow hill-hugging trail.

The first noticeable change in grade is a mile and half beyond Polls Gap when the trail reaches the Cataloochee Divide and drops into Garretts Gap.\r\n\nFrom the gap, the trail enters an easy 500-yard climb around the north side of Buck Knob. Upon circling the knob, the trail returns to the crest of the divide and begins a gentle three-quarter-mile descent to Maggot Spring Gap.\r\n\nFrom Maggot Spring Gap, the trail resumes an easy cadence of climbing and descending along the spine of the Cataloochee Divide which, from this point, also corresponds with the park boundary. Over a two-mile interval, the trail visits Sheepback Knob, Little Bald Knob, Pine Tree Gap, and Hemphill Bald.\r\n\nWhen it leaves the summit of Hemphill Bald, the trail enters a steep three-quarter-mile descent into Double Gap. For most of the way, the trail remains within the woods, offering no clear vantage points. At Double Gap, the path meets the western terminus of the Cataloochee Divide Trail.\r\n\nFrom there, the Hemphill Bald Trail turns left and proceeds into the Cataloochee basin on a steep angling course across the north flank of the divide. The trail becomes progressively rougher, soon reaching a boulder-strewn terrain thick with vines and low woody infestations. A little more than a half-mile below Double Gap, the trail makes a sharp switchback across the boulder field. Seepages are frequent. In places where the slope is especially steep, openings in the forest permit views of Mount Sterling Ridge and the main Smoky divide.\r\n\nSeven hundred yards below the switchback, the trail crosses the headwaters of Double Gap Branch. The trail continues descending steeply for a little more than a half-mile to a second switchback that brings it into the Double Gap Branch drainage. Over the next mile, the route crosses a couple of feeder streams and crosses the Double Gap Branch four more times.\r\n\nJust prior to the third crossing, a large northern red oak sits to the right of the trail. This particular tree was once identified by the TVA Forestry Division as having superior timber-producing qualities and as a source for developing seed stock.\r\n\nA little more than a half-mile below the third crossing, the trail clears Double Gap Branch for the final time before proceeding 250 yards to terminate into the Caldwell Fork Trail in a small forest opening.\r\n\nThis content was contributed by author Ken Wise.

Open fields spaced irregularly along the south flank of the divide afford glimpses down into the Jonathan Creek drainage. \r\n\nA readily noticeable break in the forest cover about a mile beyond Cove Creek Gap affords the only good vantage point along the trail for looking down into the Cataloochee basin. In the intermediate distance, Noland Mountain slants across the basin, marking the boundary between Big and Little Cataloochee. Mount Sterling Ridge, anchored by Big Cataloochee Mountain on the west, forms the distant northern edge of the basin. Scottish Mountain appears as the prominent peak to the east.\r\n\nFrom there, the trail continues along the spine of the divide for almost a mile before reaching Panther Spring Gap. Past the gap, the route follows the park boundary while traversing several minor knobs. The trail remains on the ridgeline except where it diverts from the boundary to avoid climbs over two of the higher knobs. For much of the way, the trail is accompanied by a split-rail fence that separates the trail from a nearby wagon road. Pleasant views abound on both sides of the trail along this section. Two miles beyond Panther Spring Gap the Science Center Trail exits to the left toward the Appalachian Highland Science Learning Center at Purchase Knob. \r\n\nThe trail continues along the boundary 450 yards to an intersection with the upper terminus of the McKee Branch Trail. On the left side of the intersection an access path exits to the Ferguson Cabin.\r\n\nWhen leaving the McKee Branch intersection, the Cataloochee Divide Trail again deviates off the ridgeline to skirt another high knob. Along here, the track is frequently churned up by horse traffic, leaving wide pockets of mud. In places, boardwalks have been installed to provide an elevated surface. The views north and south contrast each other as visitors compare the patchwork of meadows and a nearby resort outside the boundary fence to heavily forested slopes within the park.\r\n\nBeyond the resort, the Cataloochee Divide Trail clears another minor knob and then descends into Double Gap to terminate in an intersection with the Hemphill Bald Trail approaching straight along the divide.

For the first mile the grade is moderate, but gradually increases in steepness as the trail negotiates the lower contours of the mountain. \r\n\nOne mile above Indian Flats, conditions deteriorate, the course becoming considerably rugged.

The trail quickly starts into a climb; within 525 yards, it crosses the Little Davidson Branch and narrows to a singletrack.\r\n\nThree hundred yards farther, the trail enters a stream-side course along Davidson Branch, following it into a deep shaded glen. From here, the route is frequently in Davidson Branch or negotiating seepages seeking the main stream. About a mile above the trailhead, an access path exits on the left and leads 665 yards to a cemetery of a single grave.\r\n\nA hundred yards above the cemetery access, the trail enters a sharp turn to cross Davidson Creek, and then begins moving out of the glen. On the left, a conspicuous path leads a few feet to the ruins of an old log out-building.\r\n\nWhen it leaves the homesite, the trail immediately enters into a steep climb that doesn\u2019t end until reaching Davidson Gap. Noticeable on the left is a stone wall running parallel to the trail. On leaving Davidson Gap, the trail descends steeply along a newly constructed surface and shortly rounds a second wall.\r\n\nWithin a half-mile, the trail completes its descent and approaches the Daniel Cook Cabin. From the cabin, the trail widens to a road and begins an easy grade. It passes through stands of rhododendron and into open fields being reclaimed by second-growth forests. Old chestnut fence posts line the fields on both sides. Pieces of household effects, old washtubs and buckets, and stone retaining walls dot the landscape.\r\n\nLess than a half-mile beyond the cabin, the trail reaches the Little Cataloochee Missionary Baptist Church standing prominently on a knoll of bare ground. When it leaves the church, the trail descends about a half-mile to Ola, a bottomland. On the left in the flat of the bottomland, the trail approaches a spring lined with a rock wall.\r\n\nAt the lower end of Ola, the trail crosses Little Cataloochee Creek on a bridge and begins climbing out of the bottomland. A quarter-mile beyond the stream crossing, a road exits on the left seventy-five yards to the Jim Hannah Cabin.\r\n\nAfter passing the access to the cabin, the trail reaches a gravel road that circles around the mountain 260 yards to intersect with the Long Bunk Trail exiting to the left. The Little Cataloochee Trail continues along the gravel track for another mile before rising to terminate at an intersection with a larger gravel road.\r\n\nThis content was contributed by author Ken Wise.

After little more than a half-mile, the Camel Gap Trail intersects the lower terminus of the Gunter Fork Trail.\r\n\nAt this juncture, the Camel Gap Trail eases out of the bottomland and into a low hummocky terrain strewn with boulders. Through here, the trail continues tracing the grade of the old rail line, though it occasionally drifts away from the stream. Big Creek at this elevation is a remarkably attractive stream characterized by large boulders and deep pools, rapidly flowing cataracts, and charming falls cloistered in luxuriant arbors of rhododendron.\r\n\nLittle elevation is gained until the trail reaches Rocky Branch one mile above the trailhead. It crosses a nameless tributary 500 yards farther along and then settles into a long, modulating course that remains high above Big Creek. Almost a half-dozen feeder streams intervene at various intervals as they make their way to Big Creek.\r\n\nA conspicuous stand of beech trees heralds the approach to a switchback that directs the trail up and away from the Big Creek drainage. On completing the switchback, the trail passes through a corridor of rhododendron and then reaches a fairly level clearing that was likely the site of some heavy industrial use by the logging operations. Beyond the clearing, the trail passes back through the upper end of the same beech stand encountered below the switchback. The grade stiffens, and the forest begins showing the first signs of transition to a northern hardwood mix. Over the next 300 yards, the trail proceeds on an easterly course across a south-facing exposure, then veers north and enters the moist, cool, shaded environs of a high-elevation ravine.\r\n\nFor the most part, the trail surface remains smooth underfoot and unimpeded by rocks. As it reaches higher elevations, however, the surface becomes rockier and the grade increases noticeably until reaching Camel Gap, where the trail terminates into the Appalachian Trail.\r\n\nThis content was contributed by author Ken Wise.

Three-quarters of a mile ahead, the trail enters a bottomland know as Indian Flats. Here it intersects the lower terminus of the Palmer Creek Trail just above the mouth of Pretty Hollow Creek.\r\n\nThe Pretty Hollow Gap Trail soon leaves Palmer Creek and narrows to a rough course following along the especially attractive Pretty Hollow Creek. The terrain here is so constricted that the trail rarely diverges away from the stream.\r\n\nFive hundred yards above the Palmer Creek junction, the trail enters Backcountry Camp 39, Pretty Hollow. Just after the camp, the route proceeds into one of the finest cove-hardwood stands anywhere in the Smokies. These large trees cast a deep gloom over the narrow, steep-sided hollow.\r\n\nFrom there, the trail begins a long, steady climb that rarely abates until reaching Mount Sterling Ridge. The nearby stream remains closely confined to the trail, but the stream itself remains obscured from view.\r\n\nA little more than a mile above the campsite, the trail makes the first of three footlog crossings of Pretty Hollow Creek. After the final crossing, it veers sharply to the left and enters the Onion Bed Branch drainage. The nearby fast-moving stream rushes about beneath the thickset rhododendron, hemlocks tower from the stream\u2019s edge, and wildflowers grow luxuriantly. Enjoyably the trail remains a bit above the stream, affording lovely views of this Smoky Mountain forest. \r\n\nSoon the trail crosses Onion Bed Branch before looping back to Pretty Hollow Creek and continuing its climb up the hollow. The grade increases incrementally as the trail enters a transition from the cove-hardwood mix to primarily hemlocks and pines. The hiking surface deteriorates to a thin, eroded berm etched into the steeply pitched slope. The stream runs far below while Indian Ridge rises straight up from the stream\u2019s edge to command the far side of Pretty Hollow. This climb continues with little variation in grade and surface condition as it edges out of the hemlock-pine stands and into the balsam zone.\r\n\nWeeds encroaching closely on the path herald the long approach into Pretty Hollow Gap and the trail\u2019s terminus into a crossroads intersection with the Mount Sterling Ridge Trail and the Swallow Fork Trail.\r\n\nThis content was contributed by author Ken Wise.

A CCC camp was located at the junction of Round Bottom Creek and Raven Fork to restore the area and build trails.  \r\n\nTrail Description: When you reach the Straight Fork Road at mile 269.8, turn left and cross the steel bridge over Straight Fork, then leave the road off to the left at the smaller trailhead parking lot at mile 270.3 for the continuation of the Beech Gap Trail. The trail after leaving the road heads very steeply uphill, climbing the west slopes of Balsam Mountain. Cross Thumper Branch at mile 271.6. This creek used to be called Stillhouse Branch. Thumping was part of the distillation process for white lightning. Continue to climb up the mountain slope to Beech Gap (aka the Big Swag) at mile 272.3 on Balsam Mountain. Logging trains crossed through this gap from Round Bottom to Pin Oak Gap carrying the valuable trees out of the mountains to the sawmills. The Balsam Mountain Trail follows the ridgeline of Balsam Mountain, crossing the gap at this point. Turn left onto the Balsam Mountain Trail and follow the crest past Balsam High Top and on to Laurel Gap at mile 274.1. Here is the newly remodeled stone Laurel Gap Shelter for which reservations must be obtained in advance. Tenting is not permitted at the shelter area. Another 0.2 miles past the Laurel Gap Shelter, turn right off the Balsam Mountain Trail onto the Mount Sterling Ridge Trail at mile 274.3. The left fork also becomes the Gunter Fork Trail. Follow the right fork on this almost level trail on the east slopes of Balsam Corner, Cataloochee Mountain (6155') and Big Butt, then gently descend to Pretty Hollow Gap at mile 278.3. At Pretty Hollow Gap, the namesake trail heads down the east slope to Cataloochee and the Swallow Fork Trail heads down the west slope toward the Big Creek Trail. The trail past Big Butt may be difficult due to the mud created by horse traffic. However, this section is really beautiful up in the aromatic fir trees with great views off the side of the mountain.\r\n\nCampsites: Tent camping is not permitted at the Laurel Gap Shelter.

The trail proceeds for 550 yards before being joined by the Gabes Mountain Trail Campground Connector.\u2028 Soon, three footlog crossings lead over Rock Creek, Crying Creek, and the main stream. A quarter-mile beyond the Crying Creek crossing, the trail exits the upper end of an old turnaround before climbing for about a half-mile to clear a small gap at the back of Bearneck Cove. Ten feet to the right of the gap is the lone grave of Sallie Sutton.\r\n\nFrom the Sutton gravesite, the Gabes Mountain Trail climbs about 600 yards to pass through Bearneck Gap and then begins descending on a wide, smooth track lined with rhododendron and well cushioned with layers of deciduous leaves. The flanking terrain soon becomes more rugged with cliffs and outcroppings forming up on either side. Slightly less than a half-mile beyond Bearneck Gap, the trail intersects an exceedingly steep access trail that exits to the right to the base of Hen Wallow Falls. Hen Wallow Falls is formed as Lower Falling Creek descends in a long picturesque waterslide.\r\n\nThree hundred and fifty yards above the access path to Hen Wallow Falls, the trail enters a sharp switchback to the left that affords a fine vantage point. From the switchback, the trail climbs a quarter-mile to enter a narrow cove. The trail winds through rhododendron, and makes two stream crossing within an interval of 515 yards. Just above the second crossing, the trail passes through a slight gap to leave the Lower Falling Creek watershed and begin circumnavigating the base of Gabes Mountain. \r\n\nA short interval of level grade precedes a one-mile winding descent to Greenbrier Creek. Over this interval, the trail probes into several recesses and engages a few streams which can be difficult to cross - Greenbrier Creek in particular. Immediately beyond is Backcountry Camp 34, Sugar Cove.\r\n\nAfter the campsite, the trail climbs out of the Greenbrier Creek drainage and into a long steady descent. Except for the occasional recesses between finger ridges, the descent precedes briskly.\r\n\nFirst, the trail crosses Buckeye Creek. Cole Creek is crossed and then crossed again eighty yards downstream. Five hundred and fifty-five yards past the second crossing of Cole Creek, the trail crosses Maddron Creek, then eases onto a moderate grade for a half-mile approach to its terminus in a wide crossroads intersection with the Maddron Bald Trail and Old Settlers Trail.\r\n\nThis content was contributed by author Ken Wise.

The trail continues its stream-side course for another half-mile before approaching Gunter Fork a second time, angling away from the stream and onto an even steeper grade. Over this interval, the trail works its way along the flank of the Gunter Fork drainage, crossing Gunter Fork twice more before completing a sharp turn that brings it back to the stream just above an attractive pool, housing a 30-foot cascade down a near vertical rock slide.\r\n\nBeyond the pool, the trail narrows to a smooth berm and proceeds on a leisurely stream-side course before approaching what appear to be two channels of Gunter Fork separated by a thirty-foot wedge of boulder-strewn ground. The trail crosses both channels, turns upstream, and proceeds to the base of Gunter Fork Cascade, a steeply pitched shield of bare rock that extends 150 feet upward from the edge of the trail. Thin sheets of water glide noiselessly down the face, forming a cascade that is remarkable both for its length and unconventional beauty.\r\n\nAt the fall\u2019s base, the trail passes through a pool and proceeds to climb a switchback angling the trail away from the stream along a narrow berm affixed to the steeply sloped mountainside.\r\n\nContinuing on, the trail follows the contours of the northern face of Balsam Mountain, where a ridge point affords glimpses of the high Smoky divide, Sevenmile Beech Ridge, and Mount Sterling Ridge.\r\n\nAt this juncture, the trail remains moderately steep as it edges onto a southerly course, climbing to the crest of Balsam Mountain, where it ends at an intersection with the Balsam Mountain Trail. As elevation is gained, the terrain becomes noticeably rocky, and there is little undergrowth except for thick beds of feathery sphagnum moss that cover the rocks.\r\n\nThis content was contributed by author Ken Wise.

The Maddron Bald Trail goes off to the left while the Albright Grove Loop Trail continues straight ahead.\n\nThe Albright Grove Loop Trail is named after Horace Albright, who was the second director of the National Park Service and worked diligently to help establish Great Smoky Mountains National Park.  The Grove is home to some of the oldest and tallest trees in the park as the area was not logged by Champion Fibre, who sold the land to the park service.  Due to its location in a more remote area of the park, the trail is not heavily traveled, allowing you to enjoy a quiet journey in the woods.\n\nAfter departing the Maddron Bald Trail, the trail narrows and begins to climb for roughly .3 miles as it follows Dunn Creek.  Eastern hemlocks and tulip poplars are plentiful throughout the grove.  If you have explored other areas of the park that were logged before its formation, youll notice that the trees here are much larger. This is an example of what a mature, cove hardwood forest looks like.  Imagine a time when all the forests in the Smokies looked like this. The trail levels off along a ridge before it turns right and descends back to meet up with the Maddron Bald Trail. During the descent, there is a small spur trail that leads to a giant tulip tree, roughly 25 feet in diameter.\n\nThe trail joins back up with the Maddron Bald Trail .3 miles away from the first trail junction.  From here, you can go to the right as the Maddron Bald Trail makes its way towards the Snake Den Ridge Trail or you can go left and head back to the parking lot.\n\nFor overnight backpackers, consider being dropped off or parking at a business along 321 (for a small fee) as vandalism and theft have been issues here in the past.", "features": "Wildflowers", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7077534/family-day-in-the-great-smoky-mountains-75-mile-afternoon-hike", "ratings": {"rating": 3.8, "num_reviewers": 9}, "stats": {"dist": 0.6, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [3321, 3113], "alt-change": [238, 51], "avg-grade": 9.0, "max-grade": 44.0}},

The Mount Sterling Ridge Trail leads to Mount Sterling which is 5842 feet high.  It is often times quite surprisingly cold.  The vegetation is similar to that found in Maine. Along the Mount Sterling Ridge Trail and the upper stretches of the Baxter Creek Trail, look for clubmoss.  The clubmoss produces abundant yellow spores containing a highly flammable oil.  The spores were once collected and used as ignition powder for fireworks and used to create the flash for early cameras. The old name of the club moss is vegetable sulfur.  The Mount Sterling Firetower is the highlight of this trip. You can climb up into the cabin at the top and view the surrounding mountains. This is a favorite spot to take sunset pictures.\r\n\nTrail Description: From Pretty Hollow Gap at mile 278.3 hike up over a knob then down into a gap then back up another ridge to a trail junction just south of Mount Sterling itself at mile 279.6. The Mount Sterling Trail goes to the right and the Baxter Creek Trail goes straight on up to the top of Mount Sterling, the highest point on the BMT at 5842'. Follow the Baxter Creek Trail to the Mount Sterling Campsite #38 at mile 280.1. Adjacent to the campsite is the old Mount Sterling Firetower. Past the firetower, the trail begins its steady descent 4000 feet to Big Creek Campground. For the first couple of miles the trail follows the crest of Mount Sterling Ridge At mile 281.9, there is a sign for the now unmaintained Big Branch Trail going off to the right. After this sign, the trail heads down the side slope of the mountain with the Baxter Creek valley on your right. You work around the point of the ridge to the west and then follow another ridgeline down toward Big Creek with now a separate tributary of Baxter Creek on your right. Finally you'll reach the bridge over Big Creek at mile 286.2. The BMT ends at this point. \r\n\nCampsites: Camping is available at the Mount Sterling Campsite #38 (reservations required) at mile 280.1 and at Big Creek Campground at the end of the BMT. The Big Creek Campground is open March 15 through October 31 and charges $14 per site. Advance reservations are highly recommended. There is a phone at the Big Creek Ranger Station which connects you to the Backcountry Reservations line for making backcountry campsite reservations as well as camping reservations for Big Creek Campground. \r\n\nWater Sources: Water is available about 0.3 miles north of the Mount Sterling campsite on a 0.2 mile side trail (should treat) and at Big Creek Campground (potable). Also, there are several seeps and small streams which cross the trail, especially at mile 284.6.

A half-mile above Trillium Branch, the trail executes a sharp switchback onto a boulder-strewn slope.\r\n\nA little more than a mile above the switchback, the trail levels out into a spacious park-like setting astride Trillium Gap, nestled between Mount Le Conte and Brushy Mountain. Trillium Gap is forested with gnarled wind-agonized beech trees, and, except where paths have been worn, the ground in the gap is covered in lush grass. \r\n\nIn Trillium Gap, the Brushy Mountain Trail intersects its western counterpart, the Trillium Gap Trail, before turning right and continuing on to terminate on the dome-like summit of Brushy Mountain.\r\n\nThis content was contributed by author Ken Wise.

Just be sure to clean/purify the water before drinking it! \r\n\nThe trail begins in what was once a community settlement known as Greenbrier, but most of the homesteads have been removed.

About a half-mile in is the Parton Homestead, which housed the ancestors of the famous country music singer and song-writer, Dolly Parton. The family cemetery is still there, near Little Bird Branch. \r\n\nThe trail then climbs what is known as the Copeland Divide, before dipping back down and following a series of creeks and stream crossings. About 6 miles into the hike is Campsite #33, Settlers Camp. There's Redwine Creek nearby for easy water access. The trail then proceeds past Ramsey Creek (same relation to the family the Ramsey Cascades were named after) and then Noisy Creek. \r\n\nThe trail continues to wind along until it reaches Texas Creek, which hikers will have to cross at a little over 10.5 miles into the trail. There are a couple of small waterfalls here which offer a nice place to take a break. Here, hikers will see the remains of even more cabins. The trail will then follow Webb Creek, and will come across another series of homesteads at about 13 miles into the trail. \r\n\nFrom there, hikers will follow a ridge along Snag Mountain before crossing Dunn Creek and Maddron Creek.

At the trailhead, you'll see a lot of dilapidated houses, that were used as summer homes for families from Knoxville. Most of the cottages were build by the early 1920s, before the land became part of Great Smoky Mountains National Park. As part of the agreement for the land to become part of the national park, families were offered long term leases, the last ones expiring in 2001. Some of the homes are being repaired, but most are off limits to the public due to structural problems.  It's a fascinating look at what the area looked like before it became a national park.\r\n\nParking at the Jakes Creek Trail parking lot in Elkmont, head about .4 miles past the dilapidated summer homes.  Roughly .3 miles past the homes, Cucumber Gap Trail veers off to the left leaving Jakes Creek Trail behind.  The trail narrows at this point and turns into a true footpath as it gains 500 feet of elevation in the first mile.\r\n\nYou'll be working your way along the trail, under a diverse hardwood forest or rhododendron, laurel, and magnolia trees.

When the trail leaves Little River Road, it turns abruptly left and begins switching sharply in and out of deep ravines as it climbs steeply out of Fighting Creek Gap. The first mile, though an arduous climb, is not without its attractions. In springtime, the adjacent slopes are festooned with numerous wildflowers. Where there are openings in the forest cover, Balsam Point and Mount Le Conte can be seen presiding in the intermediate distance while below is the long graceful sweep of the Fighting Creek watershed.\r\n\nOver the course of the first three miles, the trail has several steep ups and downs. The first significant descent occurs one mile above Fighting Creek Gap where the trail enters a long, even drop into Mids Gap. \r\n\nFrom Mids Gap, the trail climbs steadily for approximately 1.5 miles before leveling and easing into a long drop to Huskey Gap. In Huskey Gap, the Sugarland Mountain Trail intersects the Huskey Gap Trail before climbing out on singletrack that, after a mile, reaches a gently sloped rock-strewn amphitheater shaded by tall cove hardwoods.\r\n\nFrom here, the trail cycles between areas of dry and moist woodlands before descending a long approach to a nameless minor gap that harbors the upper terminus of the Rough Creek Trail.\r\n\nFrom the junction, the Sugarland Mountain Trail climbs to the knife-edged spine of Sugarland Mountain, remaining on the spine for only a short distance before deviating around a high knob, passing through it into a more open exposure bearing a northern hardwood mix. The distance along the knife-edge is not far, perhaps a quarter-mile, before the grade stiffens noticeably, and the Sugarland Mountain Trail enters the boreal zone.\r\n\nAt this point, the trail proceeds through birches into a steady climb angling across a slope of wildflowers. Here, the grasses that softened much of the earlier trail give way to a rockier course. The higher the trail climbs, the more it degenerates into a rough, rutted track. In an opening at the left of the trail, the headwaters of Moccasin Branch form up from a weak spring with a white vinyl pipe. The Moccasin Branch Spring is the closest source for the nearby Mount Collins Shelter.\r\n\nBeyond the shelter, the Sugarland Mountain Trail winds on a level course through balsam woods to terminate into the Appalachian Trail just below the summit of Mount Collins.\r\n\nThis content was contributed by author Ken Wise.

From the Sugarlands Visitor Center near Gatlinburg, drive about 11.5 miles to reach the Sinks parking lot.\r\n\nThe Meigs Creek Trail starts at one of the most popular swimming holes in the Smokies, the Sinks.  While it is popular, the area around the falls can be dangerous due to undertow, so be careful if you get close to the cascading water. The parking lot can fill up in the summers, especially on the weekends, so get there early to beat the crowds. The trail climbs up a series of stone steps before it descends into a boggy area. You'll see bamboo, paw-paw patches, and possibly mosquitoes as you move through this area. The trail starts climbing along a ridge that extends from Curry He Mountain, and at times, you'll be able to see the Little River on the right. Once you switch back around the ridge, the area becomes dry. Rattlesnakes have been seen in this area, so watch where you step as you make your way along the trail.\r\n\nThe trail descends for about half a mile until the trail meets Meigs Creek and your stream-crossing adventure begins. Over the next 1.5 miles of ascent, you'll cross the creek 18 times without the assistance of any footbridges. Depending on how much it's rained, the creek crossings range from easy (in low water) to tricky (in high water). There are times where the creek gets very close to the trail, and various cascades and pools are just off to the side of the trail. Logging this area would have been difficult with all the water, so there are areas where larger trees can be viewed. \r\n\nAt about 2.5 miles, you'll encounter Bloody Branch, named for an area where settler William Walker is rumored to have found his hogs one year and slaughtered them on the spot instead of trying to drive them home. The trail continues to climb, although creek crossings are now smaller than when you started. You finally arrive at Buckhorn Gap, where the junction of the Lumber Ridge Trail to Tremont comes in from the right and the Meigs Mountain Trail to Element comes in from the left. At this point, you have several options outside of just turning around and returning to your car at the Sinks.\r\n\nDue to all of the water crossings, it is recommended that you have appropriate footwear and possibly trekking poles to help you with the crossings.

It is particularly interesting in the winter, when the absence of foliage permits views of many of the major peaks in the western end of the Smokies.\r\n\nWhen it leaves Wear Cove Gap Road, the Roundtop Trail enters a winding climb. A half-mile above the road, it circles south to clear a minor ridge point where Roundtop appears prominently as the cone-shaped peak immediately to the west. After clearing the ridge point, the trail turns back north and encounters the park boundary.\r\n\nAfter visiting the boundary briefly, the trail turns south again for a winding circumnavigation of Joint Ridge, a spur that extends south from the flank of Roundtop. As the trail approaches the end of Joint Ridge, a series of forested peaks erupt into view. \r\n\nUpon reaching the west flank of Joint Ridge, the Roundtop Trail descends into the wide bottom of a hollow. At the bottom, the trail turns and begins an easy half-mile climb out of the hollow and onto a dry southwestern exposure. Here it begins a descent that ranks among the two or three steepest descents in the Smokies. The trail descends on a narrow track that slants badly from left to right and is cushioned with layers of friction-free pine needles that make it difficult to procure traction. The descent ends in a sharp switchback that directs the trail into a hollow drained by Cane Creek.\r\n\nBeyond the Cane Creek drainage, the trail briefly encounters the boundary for the second time, then returns to another southern exposure where the track is very narrow and perched precariously on the slope.\r\n\nConditions moderate noticeably when the trail turns and begins a 2 mile drop to Little River, winding gently along the contours of a meandering ridgeline before becoming tighter and steeper. For the final half-mile, it treads on a ledge cut into the cliff before dropping sharply to reach the stream.\r\n\nAs the Roundtop Trail approaches Little River, the track forks. Head to the right to a large pool formed by the confluence of Little River and the West Prong. Here, the river is widest and generally easier to cross.\r\n\nThis content was contributed by author Ken Wise.

You can take the Little River Road to Metcalf Bottom, drive straight across the bridge and go about 1.25 miles to the park boundary, where you can park. You can also access the trail by going through Wears Valley and taking the Wear Cove Gap Road to the park boundary.\r\n\nSince this trail begins on the park boundary, it's a great trail even if most of the park roads are closed due to high water or snow. Even though it is easy to get to and has beautiful views, this trail is rarely used, so it is great if you are looking to get away from the crowds. As you start to work your way uphill, you get your first taste of what the majority of the trail will be. This trail climbs almost 2000 feet from where the trail starts at Wears Cove to Laurel Falls Trail. Its a continuous climb, but most people agree its not hard.  \r\n\nAs you work your way along the park boundary, you catch glimpses into Wear Cove, which lies outside the park. You'll continue in and out of the park as you follow the trail. When you reach 1.9 miles, you reach Little Brier Gap. You can take a right turn and work your way down to the Walker Sisters homesite, about .6 miles from the gap. It's a quick side trip, but worth it if you haven't visited the site on another outing. If you've been there before, continue your trek straight ahead to begin climbing Chinquapin Ridge. \r\n\nYou'll work your way up the ridge as it begins to wind through the mountains. When you look into Wear Cove, you're looking into one of three valleys in the area. Coves like Wear, Cades, and Tuckaleechee were all opened when softer rock, like phyllite, was worn down and the valleys opened up.  \r\n\nAround mile 4, the forest opens up a little bit as you cross the ridge and come to the Laurel Falls Trail and the end of the trail. At this point, you can turn left and climb another mile to the summit of Cove Mountain, and the old fire tower there. If you turn left and work your way downhill about 1.8 miles, you'll get to Laurel Falls the most visited waterfall in the park.

The school and cemetery remain today, offering a glimpse of what life was like in the community. The wide path was an old road that follows the stream, Little Brier Branch toward Cove Mountain. It's an easy hike with a log footbridge allowing you easy passage across the creek.   \r\n\nAt 1.1 miles, there is a side trail that leads to the Walker Sisters Place.

Upon clearing the ridgeline at a sharp turn to the left, the trail descends steeply, following a ravine for a quarter-mile, then easing out onto a downstream course to a crossing along Baskins Creek.\r\n\nWhere the trail crosses Baskins Creek, the stream is deep and usually difficult to rock hop. After crossing, the trail switches back and into a low intervale between Baskins Creek and Falls Branch, where it follows an easy course to intersect an access path on the right leading downstream along Falls Branch a quarter-mile to Baskins Creek Falls.\r\n\nThe access path is a level course along Falls Branch except for the final approach where it clears a slight rise and then enters an exceedingly steep descent to the base of a great sandstone bluff. The bluff is an imposing natural edifice that guards the upper end of a wide, flat hollow. Near the center of the amphitheater, Falls Branch flows over the upper edge of a cliff and drops thirty-five feet to form Baskins Creek Falls.\r\n\nA quarter-mile above the point where the Baskins Creek Trail passes the access path to the falls, the trail intersects another access path leading to the Baskins Creek Cemetery. Perched on a small knoll above the stream, the tiny plot bears a little more than two dozen graves, all but one marked with thin weather-worn fieldstones.\r\n\nWhen it leaves the access to the cemetery, the trail turns and enters a steep hollow, climbing moderately before crossing Falls Branch.

Largely because of its considerable length and change in elevation, the trail is home to an astonishing variety of wildflowers and a wide range of tree species. \r\n\nThe Thomas Divide Trail begins in a nameless depression where Newfound Gap Road crosses over the divide. The trail starts on an easy course following the ridgeline. From the outset, the track is even and soft underfoot. It remains as such for most of the trail\u2019s course. Though not readily noticeable, the trail eases off Thomas Divide for a short diversion out and back along Beetree Ridge before settling into a gentle climb. \r\n\nAlmost two miles from the trailhead, the Thomas Divide Trail eases into a dell on the ridgeline where it intersects the upper terminus of the Kanati Fork Trail.\r\n\nFrom the Kanati Fork junction, the Thomas Divide Trail climbs moderately for a half-mile to the top of Nettle Creek Bald. Irrespective of its name, Nettle Creek Bald is completely overgrown, though it affords limited views south along the spine of the divide to Newton Bald and east across the Oconaluftee watershed to Hughes Ridge.\r\n\nAs the trail eases off Nettle Creek Bald, it descends moderately for a little more than a mile to Tuskee Gap and then climbs on a corresponding grade for a half-mile before dropping into an intersection with the Sunkota Ridge Trail entering from the right. From this junction, the Thomas Divide Trail continues on a slight climb for almost another mile to approach the western perimeter of Newton Bald, where it meets the Newton Bald Trail.\r\n\nBeyond the Newton Bald junction, the Thomas Divide Trail offers a one-mile respite from the climbing before entering a very steep descent into Deeplow Gap.\r\n\nIn Deeplow Gap, the Thomas Divide Trail intersects the Deeplow Gap Trail before a steep one-mile climb out along the divide. At the top of the climb, the trail starts into a steep descent that persists through a junction with the Indian Creek Motor Trail until its end at the park boundary. Here, at its intersection with the Indian Creek Motor Trail, the Thomas Divide Trail leaves its narrow cushioned track for the wider rougher course of the unimproved road. The steepness of the grade does not diminish, continuing for an additional two miles until the trail reaches Stone Pile Gap and Tom Branch Road.\r\n\nThis content was contributed by author Ken Wise.

On the site is a large \u201csaddlebag\u201d type cabin consisting of two halves built around a central chimney. The right half was built shortly after Ogle and his wife Cindy moved to Jungle in 1879. The left half was added as more space was needed for their expanding family. Both \u201chalves\u201d have front and back doors, and porches extend along the full length of the front and back of the cabin. Through a flume built of wood, water from a nearby spring was delivered to a rough wooden trough next to the house.\r\n\nAbove the cabin is a four-crib log barn with lofts and a high frame roof. The lower part of the barn is constructed of large poplar logs that are, like many pioneer structures in the Smokies, joined at the corners with dove-tailed notching.\r\n\nIn the 1920s when the Tennessee Park Commission was acquiring land for the newly proposed national park, the 660-acre Jungle tract was one parcel that went to a \u201cjury of view\u201d of four persons who valued the land about $140,000 less than its owner demanded. When this decision was appealed, a full jury reduced the legal value another $15,000. The owner received about $26 per acre for the land, hardly enough to cover the cost of the lawyers who represented him. Jungle, like much of the land in the Smokies, essentially was stolen. It was the contention of many landowners in the Smokies that the Park Commission, through legal manipulation, had acquired their land for scandalous prices. As a result, there was considerable enmity between many of the local residents and the Park Commission.\r\n\nThis content was contributed by author Ken Wise.

Turning to the right, it runs up the east slope of Bote Mountain connecting the various gaps that exist on the ridge. You'll encounter the Finley Cane Trail next, which leads back down to the Laurel Creek Road. \r\n\nAs the trail continues straight, the climb begins in earnest beneath a forest of hardwoods, pine-oaks, and rhododendron. A mile past the Finley Cane Trail, you'll enter an area that was burned in 1987 when lightning started a fire and scorched most of the south side of the trail down to West Prong. The forest is recovering, but scars from the blaze still remain. \r\n\nAs you leave the fire area, views of Thunderhead and Defeat Ridge are off to the left of the trail until you reach the Lead Cove Trail junction, another trail that leads back to Laurel Creek Road. The trail continues to remain dry along the crest of Bote Mountain as you keep climbing to the Anthony Creek Trail junction, a trail that descends steeply to the Cades Cove Picnic Area.\r\n\nThe trail narrows at this point due to cattle being driven through this area in the summer where they grazed at Spence Field. With thousands of cattle going up and down the trail, the mud was worn down to the bedrock, thus leaving the trail that exists today. The trail is very rocky as it passes through the rhododendron tunnels.  During rainstorms, water runs down the middle of the trail, so make sure you have appropriate footwear.  The trail widens again, but gets rockier as you approach the AT and Spence Field. \r\n\nAfter 7 miles, you have reached what some consider the most beautiful spot on the crest of the Smokies. There are clear areas where sweeping views of the TN side and NC side of the Smokies are the reward for your climb. This grass meadows make for great places to have lunch, and the various berry bushes make it a great place for bears to feast in late summer.

The road course here is dry and sandy, heavily eroded, and often encumbered with roots and rocks.\r\n\nWhen the Cooper Road Trail reaches the crest of Hatcher Mountain, it enters a crossroads that marks the intersection of Cooper Road with the Hatcher Mountain Trail and the Beard Cane Trail before descending steadily on a rough, rocky course to a stream crossing. The steepness moderates, and the roughness subsides as the trail proceeds to the coolness of a shaded hollow where it immediately crosses a tributary of Wilson Branch. Farther along, the trail completes a messy crossing of Wilson Branch and then turns and proceeds up the hollow following the course of a small feeder stream.\r\n\nAt the head of the draw, the trail crosses the feeder and enters into a steep climb to the crest of Stony Ridge. Upon clearing Stony Ridge, the trail descends to an easy crossing of Stony Branch and then turns and starts into a climb to the crest of Arbutus Ridge. As it eases onto the ridge, the trail turns sharply back to the left to follow the ridgeline briefly before dropping off for a steep descent into the Arbutus Branch drainage. Here, the course winds considerably on a track that is wide, smooth, and shaded by pines before ending at a tributary of Arbutus Branch.\r\n\nCrossing Arbutus Branch on a concrete causeway, the trail proceeds downstream for a short distance, approaching Cades Cove before intersecting the upper terminus of the Wet Bottom Trail just before the trail\u2019s end.\r\n\nThis content was contributed by author Ken Wise.

Caves in the Whiteoak Sink area provide homes for bats, although most caves are closed due to the threat of White Nose Syndrome.\r\n\nAs the trail continues to climb slightly to Schoolhouse Gap, you meet the Chestnut Top Trail at 2.0 miles, a trail that leads down to the Townsend Y. The trail continues for another .2 miles until it reaches Schoolhouse Gap and the park boundary. While there is no record of a school being at the gap, the name may refer to the fact that students walked through the gap in order to go to school in Townsend.  \r\n\nPrivate homes you see here are outside the park boundary and give the visitor an idea of what the area would be like if the woods weren't protected by the park service.

You'll notice a high number of children buried here, which speaks to the high infant mortality rate in the 1800s and early 1900s. Family names you'll see in the cemetery are Moore, Stinnett, Carlyle, Cook, and McCarter. These families lived in the Tremont area, making a life for themselves living off the land.  Once you have looked around, you can go back the way you came to pick up the trail or take a rough path through the woods to rejoin the West Prong a little further up the trail.

If the water level is high, you may want to plan another route as crossing the Lynn Camp Prong can be dangerous.  At low to medium levels, you can try to cross the creek using boulders strewn throughout creek.  In the summer, you can take off your boots and wade across.\r\n\nOn the other side of the creek, the trail climbs along an old railroad bed, a reminder that the Little River Lumber Company logged this area before it became a national park.  At mile .3, the trail crosses Panther Creek for the first time. The trail continues to ascend until you reach mile .8, where 2 creek crossings have to be navigated.  As the trail continues to climb Timber Ridge, the creek crossings become easier.  After passing a small cascade at mile .9, the trail begins to narrow.  \r\n\nStarting at mile 1.0, creek crossings become more frequent as the trail crosses Panther Creek multiple times. The narrow valley and moisture makes for the perfect environment for rhododendron.  The rosebay rhododendron in this area bloom in July, making it a good time to be on this trail if you don't mind the heat.\r\n\nAt mile 2.0, the trail crosses Panther Creek for the last time, a simple hop compared to the rest of the crossings.  The trail soon arrives at Jakes Gap, which lies in the middle of a hardwood forest.  In Jakes Gap, there are several trail junctions that provides a variety of options at this point.

You'll notice chutes, falls, and pools in the river as you make your way up the trail.  The trail begins to level out and at .7 miles, there is a bench where you can rest.   There is a small waterfall in this area that is the remains of old splash dams, which were used by the loggers to help get logs down the mountain to the sawmill in Townsend.  \r\n\nThe trail levels out as it follows the creek, and another bench beside the road is provided for you to rest and take in more wildflowers.  At 2.0 miles, there is a narrow trail to the right that leads to an old car frame, which speaks to the area's use as a CCC camp during the Great Depression.  \r\n\nAs you continue on the trail, you'll encounter the Panther Creek Trail, which goes off to the left as your trail narrows straight ahead.  The Middle Prong CCC Camp was built in this area as crews constructed roads in the park between 1933 and 1937.  After the camp, the trail continues the climb, and starts to switchback.

From start to finish, it follows a smooth, wide roadbed over a slight grade. The trail begins from a wide intersection with the Deep Creek Trail close to the confluence of Indian and Deep creeks and immediately alongside the concrete bridge where the Deep Creek Trail crosses Indian Creek.\r\n\nA hundred yards above the trailhead, an access path on the left descends sharply twenty yards to the base of Indian Creek Falls. Here, the stream thunders over ledges arranged like steps of a colossal stairway before reaching a sharply pitched incline of smooth rock. Below, the water collects in an agitated boil before surging down through a channel to join Deep Creek. Because of the inherent attractiveness of the display of cascading water, the area is heavily worn by visitors.\r\n\nA hundred and twenty-five yards above the access to Indian Creek Falls, the trail crosses the stream on a wooden bridge and begins following an old wagon road. Three-quarters of a mile in, the trail intersects the eastern terminus of the Loop Trail. A little more than a half-mile beyond this intersection, the Queen Branch flows into Indian Creek just below the trail to the right. Just opposite, the Laney Cemetery Access path leads to the left.\r\n\nFrom here, the trail passes along the upper side of an extended bottomland. Along the way, a few faint foundations and discarded household items are all that remains of previous homesteads. Just before the second of three bridge crossings, an access pass to the right leads 400 yards up to the Upper Indian Creek Cemetery (also know as Queen Cemetery). Shortly after the third bridge crossing, the trail intersects with the western terminus of the Deeplow Gap Trail.

Initially, the trail starts with an easy grade, but soon steepens as it ascends through dry-ridge conditions for almost two miles until crossing a tributary of Juney Whank Branch. \r\n\nAbove the crossing, the trail works its way into a narrow shaded hollow. The trail soon completes a switchback and proceeds a half-mile back out of the hollow to reach the rocky spine of Beaugard Ridge. At this juncture, the trail turns northerly along the east side of the ridge which affords plenty of vantage points. The grade and trail conditions remain unchanged for the next two miles until a very sharp switchback ushers hikers onto a very narrow ridge where openings in the forest afford astonishing panorama views.\r\n\nThe knife-edge spine on Beaugard Ridge extends for no more than a hundred yards, its upper end punctuated by Lonesome Pine Overlook, which can be reached by a 50-yard access path. The summit of the overlook is a great spot to sit and enjoy the views over snacks or lunch.\r\n\nA mile and a half above the overlook, the trail completes another sharp switchback and passes through a wet patch while circling east below the summit of Coburn Knob. After the knob, the trail begins an easy one-mile descent into Lower Sassafras Gap. For much of the way the divide is narrow, and the trail stays to the crest of the ridge, affording occasional views. At the gap, the trail veers to pass around the west side of Sassafras Knob.\r\n\nA little more than a mile past Lower Sassafras Gap, the trail completes its circumnavigation of Sassafras Knob and drops into Upper Sassafras Gap, where it intersects the Noland Creek Trail on the west and the Pole Road Creek Trail on the east. From the gap, the trail continues steeply into a rhododendron-laurel tunnel. A mile above Upper Sassafras Gap, the crest of the divide widens to a noticeable flat, marking the upper end of Roundtop Knob.\r\n\nThe climb continues as the trail soon enters a pleasant stand of silent fir trees. The grade is moderate, and the thick spongy humus of a boreal forest renders the track soft underfoot. A mile-and-a-half above Roundtop Knob, the trail widens to a grassy jeep track.

The final option is to hike 10.5 miles along the Appalachian Trail (AT) from Newfound Gap to Peck's Corner and the trailhead, allowing you to hike Hughes Ridge Trail in reverse.\r\n\nThanks to its more remote location in the backcountry, the Hughes Ridge Trail offers a wildflower hike without the crowds found in other areas of the park. While you may encounter day hikers on the way to the trail, once you turn onto Hughes Ridge Trail, you'll probably only encounter a couple of backpackers who spent the night at Campsite #47 or #48 on Chasten Creek Trail or Peck's Corner Shelter on the AT.

In quick succession, three tight switchbacks conduct the trail steeply down the flank of the mountain to the edge of Raven Fork, and then immediately to a metal frame bridge spanning the stream.\r\n\nAt the far end of the bridge, the Enloe Creek Backcountry Campsite (#47) is fitted deftly on a small bench, perched against a cliff high over Raven Fork.\r\n\nThe Enloe Creek Trail passes through the middle of the campsite and exits along the back corner. It then angles steeply up the adjacent slope on a course roughly parallel to Raven Fork. Within a quarter-mile, the trail enters a long gradual veer to the right, edging away from the Raven Fork gorge and into the Enloe Creek drainage. Enloe Creek finally comes into view about a half-mile above the campsite. During the cooler seasons when intervening vegetation is not too dense, several small waterfalls and shoals can be seen gracing the slow-moving stream. \r\n\nTwo miles above the campsite, the trail approaches Enloe Creek and crosses on a long slender footlog bridge. It immediately climbs through exceptionally wet and rocky terrain that is almost hazardous to traverse. A hundred yards up, the trail eases onto a more suitable track and enters an old-growth cove-hardwood forest of remarkable fecundity. Wildflowers, weeds, and low woody growth encroach on the trail which is flanked by venerable red spruces, yellow buckeyes, yellow birches, and Carolina silverbells. The riot of growth in this enclosure is unmatched by all but a few enclaves of the Smokies.\r\n\nA mile above the stream crossing, the trail completes a wide double-switchback that directs the trail away from the Enloe Creek drainage and onto the east flank of Hughes Ridge. The grade remains steep and the course narrow, but conditions become somewhat less rocky. Five hundred yards above the switchback, the trail passes through a false gap and into an open forest of second-growth hardwoods. Along here the slopes are blanketed with ranks of large-flower trilliums interspersed with wild geraniums and violets.

It then begins to climb, moving out of the pines and into a dry-ridge forest rich with hardwoods. \r\n\nSunkota is believed to be a garbled rendition of the Cherokee word for apple, thus insinuating that apple trees once grew on the nearby slopes. If this was the case, the apple trees have long since disappeared.\r\n\nThe trail climbs a moderate grade for three miles and then descends about three-quarters of a mile to Martins Gap, where it intersects the Martins Gap Trail, a three-mile lateral connector between Bryson Place on Deep Creek and the upper terminus of the Indian Creek Trail.\r\n\nAlong the route, there are no readily apparent differences in character or quality as the trail goes on.

The best way to get this is to start on Clingmans Dome Road and head down the Noland Divide Trail for 3.7 miles to the junction with the Pole Road Creek Trail.\r\n\nThe trail descends from Upper Sassafras Gap along a dry ridge through a second growth forest.   Wildflowers are found along the trail as it transitions into a cooler, wet, cove environment.  As the trail continues downhill, it crosses Pole Road Creek for the first of many crossings.  There are several small cascades that offer great photo opportunities if you are looking at the creek by the trail.  The trail runs on the left side of the creek at this point and comes to a spot where a view of a waterfall is offered through the trees. The trail continues descending as it passes through a large stand of tulip trees at the 2 mile mark. \r\n\nAhead, the trail crosses Pole Road Creek and some feeder creeks multiple times.  Rock hops are the the method for getting across these water hazards, so be aware if you are on trail after rain storms have gone through the area.  If there has been rain, it might be worth finding a different trail until the creeks slow down some.  \r\n\nWildflowers continue to be seen alongside the trail, making it great for wildflower lovers.  Finally, the valley widens out a little bit and the trail levels out. A foot-log over Deep Creek brings the trail to its end at the junction with Deep Creek Trail.  \r\n\nAt this point, you can either return to Clingmans Dome Road via the trails you just descended, although that is a lot of climbing to reach the road.

Thus, many huge trees are to be found as the trail follows along the course of the creek. Also, of note, the original owners of the property, Abraham and Wes Enloe, owned most of the land down near Raven Fork and Straight Fork. A farm hand named Nancy Hanks became pregnant, though it is not certain who the father was. Wes Enloe helped her to relocate to Kentucky. So the story goes, she named her son Abraham Lincoln, who became president. The veracity of this story is disputed by most historians. \r\n\nTrail Description: This section covers from the Chasteen Creek/Hughes Ridge Trail intersection to the parking areas at Round Bottom on Straight Fork Road. From this intersection at mile 261.1, continue down the Hughes Ridge Trail to its junction with the Enloe Creek Trail at mile 261.5. Go right heading down Enloe Creek Trail, first through a saddle which may be overgrown with underbrush, then down the west side of Enloe Ridge through a series of switchbacks until you reach the headwaters of Enloe Creek. Cross Enloe Creek on a footbridge (washed out in 2011) at mile 263.0 and come to Enloe Creek Campsite #47 at mile 264.1. Adjacent to the campsite is a large steel bridge over Raven Fork, a very sizable stream, which is a great place to swim or fish. After crossing this stream on the bridge, the trail heads steeply uphill onto the slopes of Hyatt Ridge, reaching the junction with the Hyatt Ridge Trail at the top of the ridge at mile 265.1. Turn left at this intersection and continue to climb up the ridgeline of Hyatt Ridge, skirting the top of Hyatt Bald which peaks out at 5153'. You'll have passed though some virgin forest to reach this point. Hyatt Bald is no longer bald but now supports its own collection of large open trees. Just a short ways past the \"bald\" you'll reach the intersection with the  Beech Gap Trail at mile 266.8. The 0.9 mile side trail to the McGee Spring Campsite #44  is to the left at the junction. Turn right and head steeply down this trail to Straight Fork. On the way down the mountainside, cross a stream at mile 268.3 as well as several other seeps during wet weather. At the bottom of the trail at Round Bottom, where the trail meets Straight Fork Road at mile 269.8, there is a trailhead parking lot for the south section of the Beech Gap Trail. From here you'll turn left and follow the road a short distance to the smaller trailhead parking lot for the north section of the Beech Gap Trail, crossing a steel bridge over Straight Fork.\r\n\nCampsites: The Enloe Creek Campsite #47 (reservations required) at mile 264.1 is small and often muddy with a waterfall closeby which may make sleeping difficult. The creek and rocks in the area as well as the steel bridge across Raven Fork just downstream from the campsite are fun for climbing on and swimming around and sitting upon for an evening sunset. The McGee Spring Campsite #44 is near Hyatt Bald. Also, at Straight Fork Road, the Round Bottom Horse Camp is to the right a short distance.\r\n\nWater Sources: Water is available at the campsites and at several creek crossings and seeps along the slopes of Hyatt Ridge and Enloe Ridge.

Ambler. His wife died in 1918 and he never returned to the Lodge. He sold it and it burned in 1926. The trail to the lodge was only 4 feet wide to discourage wagons and increase privacy.\r\n\nThere are two trails leading to the Lodge. One is a 1/2 mile steep climb from the Blue Ridge Parkway and the other is a shorter, and easier, hike from Ox Creek Road of about 1.4 miles. Ox Creek is near Weaverville, NC and about 14 miles north of Asheville.\r\n\nAbout halfway to the Lodge is a nice view of the mountains. The rock foundation of the Cow Barn is on the right as you approach the lodge area on the Mountains to Sea Trail (from Ox Creek Road). The pool was only a few of feet deep, for safety, and being fed by a mountain spring, was quite cold. The water was furnished by an underground aqueduct.\r\n\nThe remains of the spring house are underneath a fallen tree (great for climbing!). The spring in the rear supplied running water through the bottom of the once fully enclosed house to keep it cool for the milk and other goods stored there. A nice informational sign marks the spot of the lodge. Actual elevation is around 3,700 (not 4,400 that is reprinted on the sign).\r\n\nThe main reservoir is about a quarter mile up a steep side trail which starts beside the large fallen tree over the spring (Blue Blaze). The reservoir, obviously roofed over for protection from the local wildlife, received water from two sources. One was from a spring at the site, which can be seen just above the reservoir, through a built-up, coverless manhole. Continue up the mountain on the trail to the other source, a spring on the Mountains to Sea Trail. This side trail is on top of the ditch dug for the water pipe. A piece of terra cotta pipe can still be seen in the middle of the trail, just beyond a rocky area shortly before reaching the upper spring. Take a right on the Mountains to Sea Trail to loop back down to the lodge area. About a quarter mile past the lodge and a small stream on the Mountains to Sea Trail is the fallen rock chimney of \"The Shack.\" A simple board cabin, with bunk beds and a fireplace, it was built for the lodge construction workers.

Wilson Ridge stays LEFT here, and Schoolhouse Connector continues right to Schoolhouse Trail 259 (Upper Thorps Creek). \r\n\nUpper Wilson Ridge is not as technical as other trails in Pisgah, but has its moments. Just after a nice side-cut section, there are a handful of uphill rooty sections next to some big trees. This is just before the fork in the trail mentioned above.

You can pick up the trailhead for the Cat Gap Loop at the Pisgah Center for Wildlife Education & Fish Hatchery.\r\n\nIf you're looking just to hike to the top of John's Rock and back out without doing the Cat Gap Loop, I recommend you start at the eastern end of the loop, on the far side of the parking lot from the Fish Hatchery. Follow the Cat Gap Loop Trail #120 (orange blaze), crossing the bridge over Cedar Rock Creek and along the Davidson River. \r\n\nYou'll pass a large campsite in a hemlock grove, and gradually begin a gentle uphill climb. You'll cross several small foot bridges over tributary streams as you gently begin to ascend into Horse Cove. You'll cross over Forest Service Road 475C before arriving at a signpost at the intersection of the Cat Gap Loop Trail #120 and John Rock Trail #365. \r\n\nTurn right uphill, following the beginning of the John Rock Trail (yellow blaze). The trail will wind around another cove with gentle up and down grades. You'll pass through a flat area to the east of John Rock, where the trail winds around before it ascends slightly into a cove filled with a dense undergrowth of mountain laurel and rhododendrons.\r\n\nThe trail will descend a little before a quick climb, and you'll suddenly emerge onto John Rock and its wonderful view. It's a great place to rest in the sun, and admire Looking Glass Rock right across the valley. If you come during Peregrine falcon nesting season, see if you can spot them nesting on Looking Glass Rock. The rock is sloped and can be very slippery if wet. It's around a 200' sheer drop, so you'll (obviously) want to be careful.\r\n\nOnce you're done taking in the views, you can either double back the way you came, or continue along the John Rock Trail back around and in a general southward direction. You'll ascend and descend a knob, which is roughly the highest portion of the trail (3320' in elevation) before descending again. Soon you'll come upon a four-way trail intersection.\r\n\nTurn right and take the Cat Gap Bypass Trail #120A west, and you'll reconnect with the Cat Gap Loop Trail #120.

The trail then co-routes with the AT by Fontana Marina and Fontana Dam Shelter, then crosses Fontana Dam. \r\n\nTrail Description: From the Tapoco Lodge gate, follow US129 (mile 179.1) south for 100 yards to Meadow Branch Road. Just up the road, you'll see a bridge crossing the creek at the James F. Burchfield Trailhead, named to honor the FS employee who fought for years to keep the Yellow Creek Mountain Trail as an active trail. Cross this bridge and head up through a series of switchbacks to the ridgeline and follow this ridgetop trail to Old Field Gap Road. Cross the road and head up the gravel road FS251 past the gate (beware of logging trucks). A short way up this road, turn left off the road onto the BMT and back up to the ridgetop. At mile 183.4 you'll reenter the FS road and follow it to the end of the road. The trail goes off the end steeply downhill. At mile 184.4 you'll reach the Powerline Road. Turn right and follow this dirt road around underneath the power lines to where the trail again leaves the road and goes to Kirkland Gap. At mile 186.3 you'll pass by an old microwave tower. At mile 186.9 Lookout Rock is an outcrop with great views toward the Smokies. At mile 187.1 at Green Gap, turn left off the ridge and follow this trail to Fontana Village Lodge at mile 188.8. The trail then follows a mountain bike trail until it intersects with the Lewellyn Cove Trail at mile 189.4. The BMT goes right on this trail, circling around the upper rim of the Cove, then intersects with the Lower Lewellyn Cove Loop Trail at mile 190.7. At mile 190.9 the BMT joins FS 2624, a gravel road. At mile 191.6 the BMT intersects with the AT. Turn north (left) onto the AT and follow it across NC 28, then by the Fontana Marina (mile 191) and the Fontana Dam AT Shelter (mile 193.4)\r\n\nCampsites: There are a few possible campsites on this section. At mile 180.8 there is a side trail to a dry campsite. At mile 182.2, 182.7, and 183.4 one could camp by the FS road. \r\n\nWater Sources: The only water along Yellow Creek Mountain is from Meadow Branch (D) and near the campsites. Water is available at Fontana Village, the marina and the AT shelter, and at the Fontana Dam Visitor Center.", "features": "Commonly Backpacked \u00b7 River/Creek \u00b7 Views", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7058574/shuckstack-fire-tower-from-the-top-of-fontana-dam-a-little-bit-closer", "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 14.1, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [3221, 1148], "alt-change": [3071, 2457], "avg-grade": 7.0, "max-grade": 56.0}},

This trail is mainly a ridgetop trail and affords nice views of the Pisgah Ledge, Looking Glass Rock, the Avery Creek valley, and Black Mountain. The terrain and vegetation varies quite a bit as you pass through a wildlife opening, traverse rocky outcrops, drop down through two gaps and climb over Coontree Mountain. After passing Coontree Gap, the trail crosses some small streams that add an array of ferns, mosses and wildflowers to the variety in vegetation. You'll notice the Bennett Gap Trail intersects the Perry Cove Trail (#151) at Saddle Gap, and then shares the trail with almost one mile of the Coontree Loop (#144)be sure to follow the red blazes.", "features": "Views", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7043661/view-from-bennett-gapcoontree-loop-trail", "ratings": {"rating": 5.0, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 2.9, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [3565, 2321], "alt-change": [153, 1325], "avg-grade": 10.0, "max-grade": 21.0}},

These very lightly traveled roads\u2014some are even gated to exclude vehicles\u2014provide surprising and delightful solitude.\r\n\nThe center of the forest is largely pocosin, nearly impenetrable upland swamp with brushy vegetation that is home to many species, including black bear. The trail, therefore, skirts the pocosins\u2014following sandy ridges that support a longleaf pine forest that is being managed to increase the population of endangered Red-cockaded Woodpeckers.\r\n\nThe star attraction of this segment, the easternmost 21 miles, is the Neusiok Trail, the longest hiking path in eastern North Carolina. The trail features pine forests and cypress swamps, boot-grabbing bogs and sandy beach, salt marsh and more pocosins. Hikers may encounter black bear, alligator, bald eagles, and several species of poisonous snakes. Boardwalks in many of the boggiest areas, and three primitive camping shelters, make this trail a great backpacking experience.\r\n\nThe Croatan is a wet place. Particularly after a rain, hikers should expect to encounter puddles and ponds on the roads and to be ready to cross hardwood wetlands that follow meandering, blackwater streams. Hikers will be rewarded, however, with views of huge bald cypress trees and possibly an alligator, songbirds like the prothonotary warbler, and many other species.\r\n\nIn between the trails and forest roads of the Croatan, the route takes hikers through the little town of Newport, and past the Newport Historical Museum and its park commemorating an 1864 Civil War battle over the Newport Barracks. The nearby town of Havelock is home to the Marine Corps Air Station at Cherry Point.\r\n\nThe Neusiok Trail is marked with 2-inch circular white markers and aluminum tags, and has a few MST signs. There is no other MST signing or blazing on this segment.\r\n\nFor more information, including camping, lodging, parking, shuttles, and resupply information, as well as detailed, turn-by-turn directions, download a trail guide from the Friends of the Mountains-to-Sea Trail.", "features": "Birding \u00b7 River/Creek", "condition": "Unknown"}, "photo": "https://www.hikingproject.com/photo/7015213/hardwood-wetlands-along-a-blackwater-stream-on-mst-segment-16b-photo-by-pj-wetze", "ratings": {"rating": 3.0, "num_reviewers": 1}, "stats": {"dist": 70.2, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [39, 3], "alt-change": [341, 343], "avg-grade": 0.0, "max-grade": 5.0}},

The first section is a steep ascent from Snowbird Creek. The next section is a typical singletrack skirting peaks and following ridges to Deep Gap. The final section from Deep Gap to a house near Hooper Bald generally follows ridges along logging roads which can be deeply rutted in places. \r\n\nFrom the start of the trail near Snowbird Creek, hikers will face a steep ascent in the first 1.25 miles with an elevation gain of 1000 feet. A reliable water source which is not visible from trail can be found nearby at Owlcamp Branch about 200 - 300 yards to right of trail. \r\n\nAfter the climb, the trail reaches Fire Scald Ridge where it follows along ridge for a moderate hike. The narrow trail skirts around west side of a 4,500 foot peak, and gradually descends into Deep Gap.\u00a0After winding west around a 4,680 foot peak, the trail climbs along Meadow Branch (on the left) for several hundred yards before reaching a gap with littered campsite and an intersecting 4WD road. Reliable water should be found along Meadow Branch. \u00a0\r\n\nAt the campsite, turn left and begin climbing to King Meadows along washed out 4WD tracks. The trail again skirts to the west of a 5,160 foot peak as it crosses Queen Ridge. The trail eventually comes to an opening with a house, and hikers will proceed uphill along the fenced boundary of this property. Follow signs at the gravel road to head back into the woods toward the left. \r\n\nAfter a short hike, you'll come to a signed trail junction with Mitchell Lick Trail #154. King Meadows Trail turns uphill to the right and becomes overgrown and a little difficult to follow for the next 300 yards. Soon the trail bears left as it crosses a wet forested area with several small streams that are bridged with old split logs. Some areas of the the trail may be overgrown, but the trail is easy to follow. \r\n\nNext, the trail begins a few switchbacks just before reaching its signed junction with Hooper Bald Trail. Turning right and hiking for a half mile will bring hikers to open meadows and views on the bald at an elevation of 5,430 feet. The parking lot is to the left. From the bald, you can enjoy views of Cherehola Skyway, Maryville, TN in the distance, and neighboring Huckleberry Bald. \r\n\nFor more information about my experiences on this trail and others in the Snowbird area, visit Uphill Hikes.", "features": "Commonly Backpacked \u00b7 Views", "condition": "Unknown"}, "ratings": {"rating": 3.5, "num_reviewers": 2}, "stats": {"dist": 6.9, "dist-type": "Point to Point", "alt-range": [5285, 2714], "alt-change": [2825, 254], "avg-grade": 8.0, "max-grade": 48.0}},

Its deep forests and remote solitude make it even more attractive to hikers who are not burdened by tools. The elevation climb from Sandy Gap north can make the trail fairly difficult to traverse. It is best to hike this section from north to south since it is mostly downhill and thus is considerably easier. Especially during the winter there are great views off the sides of the mountain both into NC and TN and sightings of bear and boar are common.\r\n\nTrail Description: From Sandy Gap at mile 137.6 (WP 33), head to the right (northeast) up the narrow rutted road. Be careful not to take the new logging road to the left of the rutted BMT route.  This stretch is quite steep. At the top of this steep section, turn left off the roadbed onto the less strenuous trail around the left side of the ridge and down into Hipps Gap, then up the right side of the next ridge to Moss Gap at mile 139.5 (WP 43). Make a sharp left hairpin turn up a steep trail to the top of Hazelnut Knob at mile 140.0 (WP 44). Descend to an unnamed gap at mile 140.3 (WP 45). Blue blazes lead to a nice campsite with a spring about 0.1 miles off to the NC side at this gap (WP 46). Head up the ridgeline to Round Top at 141.5. Be careful not to take the trail created by OHV traffic down the right NC side of the ridge on top of Round Top. A spring marked with blue blazes is present close to the trail at mile 141.6 in a small gap between the two knobs of Round Top. The trail then heads on down the ridgeline, then back up steeply to Rocky Top at mile 143.5 (WP 50). Sledrunner Gap (WP 51) is the next gap past Rocky Top, at mile 143.9. The BMT cuts left down the Brookshire Creek drainage, but going straight will lead you steeply uphill to Beaverdam Bald (WP 52) in another 0.5 miles. The bald is accessible by road and has ample vehicle parking space.\r\n\nCampsites: LNT primitive campsites are abundant, but the best is at the gap just north of Hazelnut at mile 140.3 (WP 46). An excellent spring is close by.\r\n\nWater Sources: Water is scarce, only reliably available at mile 140.3 (WP 46, A) and 141.6 (WP 48, A). The trail to these two springs are marked with blue diamond blazes. If dry, go down the draw until you reach water.

Brookshire Creek is a sparkling stream with several small waterfalls. The Bald River is a fast flowing mountain river which dwindles away to nothing as you ascend the south flank of Sugar Mountain on the BMT. The Tellico River is famous for its trout fishing and for class IV and V canoeing and kayaking. At the Tellico River, a trout fish hatchery is just over the bridge from the parking area and worth the visit to see the huge breeder fish.\r\n\nTrail Description: From Sledrunner Gap at mile 143.9 the BMT enters wilderness, thus no white diamond blazes are to be found. However, a few old rectangular white AT-like blazes are still evident along the Brookshire Creek Trail down to the Bald River. Head left down the Brookshire Creek drainage. The BMT intersects the Brookshire Creek Trail (#180, WP 53) at mile 144.1. Keep left, heading downhill. The trail follows the Brookshire Creek drainage until this creek joins the Bald River at mile 147.1 (WP 54). A short ways down the trail to the left there is a 25 foot waterfall on the Bald River. Turn right, heading up the Bald River drainage, almost immediately first crossing Brookshire Creek above a small waterfall. This trail climbs up the south flank of Sugar Mountain and crosses the Bald River at mile at 148.1 (WP 55), then another side creek at 148.5, reaching the top of Sugar Mountain at 149.6 (WP 56). Here the trail leaves the wilderness and crosses a gated forest service road and heads down the north flank of Sugar Mountain, reaching the Tellico River Road at mile 152.0 (WP 57). Turn left and hike a short distance to a picnic area with pit toilets next to the bridge over the Tellico River (WP 58).\r\n\nCampsites: Primitive LNT campsites are possible at several sites along this segment. One particularly nice one is along Brookshire Creek at mile 145.7 (WP 59).\r\n\nWater Sources: Water is available all along Brookshire Creek, at the Bald River crossing at mile 148.1 (WP 55, C), as well as another feeder creek crossing at 148.5 (WP 56, B), and from the Tellico river at mile 152.0 (WP 58), but must be sterilized.

This is a popular trailhead, with the possibility to make long and short loops in the area. See for example Sam's Knob Loop. The Shining Rock Wilderness lies just to the north. \r\n\nThe trail follows a railbed dating from early in the last century when the area was heavily logged. This logging lead to the peculiar \"balds\" on the tops of mountains where the forests are unable to reestablish themselves due to soil erosion. The balds offer great views though. \r\n\nNevertheless, because the trail follows an old rail bed, it descends continuously at a relatively moderate grade. (Or if hiking in the reverse direction, the moderate ascent makes it possible for us flatlanders who aren't accustomed to such altitudes not to gasp too much for air.) \r\n\nThe trail first passes through a meadow at the top of Black Balsam, but the latter half enters into the forest. The forest also features rhododendrons and berry bushes. Much of the trail can be quite rocky and technical in places due to washed out and rutted areas. There are several creek crossings as well as other areas along the trail where the water runs along the trail. Bring waterproof boots or expect to get wet feet, and expect to get a little muddy either way.  \r\n\nThere are a couple of small waterfalls visible from the trail, particularly near the end. The most notable is Wildcat Falls around the 3-mile mark, which is viewable from a concrete bridge that presumably used to be part of the railroad.

But you are quickly rewarded with a break and a view at Shuckstack Fire Tower a little over 4 miles in. Climb the tower, one of four fire towers in the park, for spectacular views of Fontana Lake to the south.\r\n\nContinue your ascent over the rest of your day to either Mollies Ridge Shelter (10.7 miles in), Russell Field Shelter (13.5 miles in), or Spence Field Shelter (16.4 miles in). Don't be surprised to encounter a bear or two in this area, especially around Spence Field\u2014a real and beautiful field where I had my first talk with a bear who was pretty unhappy; I was attempting to use the same bush he was eating from to take care of business... Needless to say I found a different spot.\r\n\nLeaving Spence Field brings you to a sequence of vistas, the most famous and incredible of which is Rocky Top. On a clear day, the 360-degree view stretches on for miles. On a more typical Smoky Mountain morning covered in dense fog, you feel as though you have found a secret passage up into the clouds as you emerge from a tunnel of mountain laurel onto the bare and rocky peak.  Following Rocky Top are many more balds, gaps, and other viewpoints worth taking a short break at to soak in the view.  \r\n\nLeaving the gaps and a string of well-built shelters brings you to perhaps the most iconic part of the trail as well as the highest point of the AT\u2014Clingman's Dome. Pray for the typical mountain fog to clear as you climb the observation tower (along with the better-smelling visitors who parked a mile away) for spectacular views. Descend among the firs into a beautiful old growth forest before coming to Newfound Gap, the easiest place to hitchhike to Tennessean or Carolinian civilization.\r\n\nThe shorter northern half of the park offers two more must-sees\u2014Charlie's Bunion, a spectacular rock outcropping, and Mt. Cammerer/Sharp Top Fire Tower, the only stone Western-style fire tower in the park (like a lighthouse on a mountain). The pattern of well-built shelters with comfortable wooden bunks continues throughout the trail. So does the flora, so keep your eyes peeled for trillium, violets, and irises.
